        "原文": "by Sandra Erwin — November 3, 2022\nA request for proposals for commercial hyperspectral satellite data is expected before year's end\nRESTON, Va. — The National Reconnaissance Office plans to continue to sign agreements with commercial satellite imaging operators. The next round of contracts will be for hyperspectral satellite data, Jeremy Banik, deputy director of the NRO Commercial Systems Program Office, said Nov. 3\n“I’m excited to say we’re finishing the RFP [request for proposals] for commercial hyperspectral remote sensing,” Banik said at the CyberSatGov conference. “We’re looking forward to exploring this emerging phenomenology that’s coming out.”\nHe said the release of the RFP is expected before the end of this year.\nHyperspectral sensors provide data across a multitude of spectral bands to enable analysts to detect phenomena in colors that typically can’t be seen by the human eye. The technology has numerous commercial applications and the NRO has for years expressed interest in using the data.\nBanik said the NRO is building on the momentum from recent contract awards for commercial space imagery, including three multibillion-dollar deals for electro-optical imagery, five study contracts for radar imagery and six study contracts for radio-frequency data.\n“We’re growing our commercial partnerships,” he said. “These partnerships, especially in recent years, really have changed the way that we operate.”\nThe NRO established the Commercial Systems Program Office in 2018 to tap into the thriving remote-sensing industry. “We plan to continue releasing multiple focus areas,” Banik said. “We will be continuously assessing or adopting new providers, adopting new technologies and emerging capabilities coming out of the industry.”\nPartnerships with companies that don’t yet have operational constellations allow the NRO access to the companies’ modeling and simulation. “And then once they’re able to start delivering real data, then we work through those demonstrations with the providers.”\nBanik’s office has pushed for “low barriers to entry” for the industry. “We’ve structured agreements so that we minimize many of the typical government contract requirements. We want to be able to cast the widest net possible to capture the best from industry.”\nForeign companies with U.S. subsidiaries, for example, are allowed to bid, said Banik. “But they must have a U.S. presence.”\n",

Hyperspectral sensors can provide data across multiple spectral bands, enabling analysts to detect phenomena that cannot be observed by naked eyes, and have been widely used in commercial fields. The US Reconnaissance Agency recently awarded three multi-billion dollar photoelectric imaging contracts, five radar imaging contracts and six radio frequency data research contracts, and will continue to expand commercial partnerships. On the one hand, lay out multiple key areas, evaluate or enable new suppliers to adopt new technologies and capabilities in the industry, such as establishing cooperative relations with companies that do not yet have operational constellations, and NRO can intervene in its modeling and simulation process. When it has the ability to provide real data, NRO completes the demonstration together with suppliers; On the other hand, lowering the \"entry threshold\" of the industry will minimize the government contract requirements by signing an agreement, and \"cast a net\" as far as possible to absorb the best things in the industry. For example, foreign companies with American subsidiaries can participate in bidding, but only if they have the permission of the United States."

        "原文": "Terma announced that SCANTER 6002 naval surveillance radar has been given a midlife update with the implementation of new technology – including drone detection. Combining the current detection capabilities with artificial intelligence classification, the SCANTER 6002 radar is now able to detect, track and classify small remote-controlled or autonomous drones.\nThe development within drone technology has leaped significantly over the past years, making advanced easy-to-fly drones accessible to almost everybody. The drones are typically equipped with high resolution cameras, long-range wireless communication, and capability to fly autonomous also outside visible line of sight. Today, drones pose an increased risk to even the most capable naval ships.\n“Small, easy-to-fly drones are without doubt here to stay and will only get more and more advanced with extended capabilities becoming a direct threat to naval security. This includes compromising missions such as surveillance, counterintelligence, and carrying explosives” says Per M. S?rensen, Senior Sales Director Naval Sales at Terma and continues:\n“Up until now it has been difficult to separate the drones from other small targets – e.g., birds. To separate the drones and other targets of interest, the radar has been updated with advanced artificial intelligence classification. The AI classifier is able to classify even the smallest drones at impressive distances, hereby assisting the operators to classify targets of interest”.\nThe SCANTER 6002 radar is the preferred radar for naval vessels globally for surface and air surveillance of own and hostile assets. With the newly added developments, the SCANTER 6002 radar provides even more value and situational awareness, still providing all the well-known capabilities including IMO navigation, helicopter control, SAR operations, surface, and lower airspace surveillance. The new solution is suitable for all types of naval, coast guards, and high-value commercial vessels.\nWith the SCANTER 6002 radar’s low peak power the operation and detection are optimal in open sea and coastal areas. The superior technical performance of the SCANTER 6002 radar with its unique frequency diversity, high sensitivity, and small cell size, provides the capability to detect even very small targets in harsh weather conditions.

        "原文": "Scientists have spent decades searching for faster, more energy-efficient memory technologies for everything from large data centers to mobile sensors and other flexible electronics. Among the most promising data storage technologies is phase-change memory, which is thousands of times faster than conventional hard drives but uses a lot of electricity.\nNow, Stanford University engineers have overcome a key obstacle that has limited widespread adoption of phase-change memory. The results are published in a Sept. 10 study in Science.\n\"People have long expected phase-change memory to replace much of the memory in our phones and laptops,\" said Eric Pop, a professor of electrical engineering and senior author of the study. \"One reason it hasn't been adopted is that it requires more power to operate than competing memory technologies. In our study, we've shown that phase-change memory can be both fast and energy efficient.\"\nElectrical resistance\nUnlike conventional memory chips built with transistors and other hardware, a typical phase-change memory device consists of a compound of three chemical elements—germanium, antimony and tellurium (GST)—sandwiched between two metal electrodes.\nConventional devices, like flash drives, store data by switching the flow of electrons on and off, a process symbolized by 1s and 0s. In phase-change memory, the 1s and 0s represent measurements of electrical resistance in the GST material—how much it resists the flow of electricity.\n\"A typical phase-change memory device can store two states of resistance: A high-resistance state 0, and a low-resistance state 1,\" said doctoral candidate Asir Intisar Khan, co-lead author of the study. \"We can switch from 1 to 0 and back again in nanoseconds using heat from electrical pulses generated by the electrodes.\"\nHeating to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) turns the GST compound into a crystalline state with low electrical resistance. At about 1,100 F (600 C), the crystalline atoms become disordered, turning a portion of the compound to an amorphous state with much higher resistance. The large difference in resistance between the amorphous and crystalline states is used to program memory and store data.\n\"This large resistance change is reversible and can be induced by switching the electrical pulses on and off,\" said Khan.\n\"You can come back years later and read the memory just by reading the resistance of each bit,\" Pop said. \"Also, once the memory is set it doesn't use any power, similar to a flash drive.\"\n'Secret sauce'\nBut switching between states typically requires a lot of power, which could reduce battery life in mobile electronics.\nTo address this challenge, the Stanford team set out to design a phase-change memory cell that operates with low power and can be embedded on flexible plastic substrates commonly used in bendable smartphones, wearable body sensors and other battery-operated mobile electronics.\n\"These devices require low cost and low energy consumption for the system to work efficiently,\" said co-lead author Alwin Daus, a postdoctoral scholar. \"But many flexible substrates lose their shape or even melt at around 390 F (200 C) and above.\"\nIn the study, Daus and his colleagues discovered that a plastic substrate with low thermal conductivity can help reduce current flow in the memory cell, allowing it to operate efficiently.\n\"Our new device lowered the programming current density by a factor of 10 on a flexible substrate and by a factor of 100 on rigid silicon,\" Pop said. \"Three ingredients went into our secret sauce: A superlattice consisting of nanosized layers of the memory material, a pore cell—a nanosized hole into which we stuffed the superlattice layers—and a thermally insulating flexible substrate. Together, they significantly improved energy efficiency.\"\nUltrafast, flexible computing\nThe ability to install fast, energy-efficient memory on mobile and flexible devices could enable a wide range of new technologies, such as real-time sensors for smart homes and biomedical monitors.\n\"Sensors have high constraints on battery lifetime, and collecting raw data to send to the cloud is very energy inefficient,\" Daus said. \"If you can process the data locally, which requires memory, it would be very helpful for implementing the Internet of Things.\"\nPhase-change memory could also usher in a new generation of ultrafast computing.\n\"Today's computers have separate chips for computing and memory,\" Khan said. \"They compute data in one place and store it in another. The data have to travel back and forth, which is highly energy inefficient.\"\nPhase-change memory could enable in-memory computing, which bridges the gap between computing and memory. In-memory computing would require a phase-change device with multiple resistance states, each capable of storing memory.\n\"Typical phase-change memory has two resistant states, high and low,\" Khan said. \"We programmed four stable resistance states, not just two, an important first step towards flexible in-memory computing.\"\nPhase-change memory could also be used in large data centers, where data storage accounts for about 15 percent of electricity consumption.\n\"The big appeal of phase-change memory is speed, but energy-efficiency in electronics also matters,\" Pop said. \"It's not just an afterthought. Anything we can do to make lower-power electronics and extend battery life will have a tremendous impact.\"\n",

        "原文": "The demonstration showcased multiple drones providing a 24-hour defensive perimeter, as well as AI-based mission planningByMike Ball/ 14 Sep 2022\nThe following news story originally appeared on the British Army website here.\nA breakthrough in technology and innovation for the British Army took place on Salisbury Plain recently, where a demonstration of multiple Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) took place. Funded by Army Headquarters, the nano-Unmanned Aerial Systems (nUAS) project completed a live multiple drone demonstration also known as swarming drones, pushing technological boundaries.\nLieutenant Colonel Arthur Dawe, Commanding Officer, Infantry Trials and Development Unit (ITDU) explains: “We are working in collaboration with the Future Capabilities Group (FCG), part of the Defence Equipment & Support (DE&S) construct. The stand-out feature of this event is that you are seeing a military operator control more than one drone at the same time from one single unit. This is adding scale and adding complexity with each drone able to carry out a separate task.”\nHe added: “This is a real amplifier, adding capacity, force protection, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The intent going forward is to add a precision strike capability; this will not only assist in our targeting but also in our strike capability, therefore making us more lethal at range which will protect our very valuable forces and people.”\nThe event was also ground-breaking in terms of the regulatory environment too, as it was the first time the Military Aviation Authority has issued a categorisation of this type for a swarm to be operated by one operator, a huge achievement for the Army and hopefully paving the way for systems like this to come into service.\nTwo different UAS systems were used; the first was the Atlas, where one operator controls four drones on a tablet via individual manual mission taskings. The second system was the Elbit, where one operator tasks six drones, creating autonomous missions. This means the operator can task up to six drones in a fleet on the same mission or various other missions to complete different tasks.\nThe focus was on two showcase ideas; the first consisted of multiple drones providing a 24-hour perimeter defensive posture, with surveillance provided by multiple UAS in and around a specific location.\nThe second scenario worked on artificial intelligence communicating with the system to plan UAS missions, so that they can provide overwatch and inform the user of any points of interest and following where necessary.\nDominic Ferrett, Lead UAS Engineer (DE&S) (FCG), noted: “This is a significant achievement for the FCG and the Army. We have now proved the concept that one person can fly six drones thus creating a reduction in operator burden.”\n“In the future we want one operator to control six, twelve, thirty, forty or more drones as part of a more integrated swarm. As we move further with future Army projects we look to human-machine teaming, which will start to bring in ground elements as well as air elements as a combined system.”\nThese demonstrations gave the UAS community the opportunity to share working knowledge and experiences. It will help to continue the work to develop UK Defence’s UAS capabilities across the Tri-Service.\nFlight Lieutenant David Morrison, Surveillance Target and Acquisition (STA) ITDU, commented: “Drones are at the forefront of technology right now and this is a real stepping stone in terms of capability. We’ve seen military operators flying these systems, not the manufacturers, and everything you see has been put together by the military operators and all flown by ourselves. This is the first steps to get soldiers using this kit and equipment.”\nLance Corporal Kai Webb, ITDU, STA operates the swarms: “I never knew that drones were a thing in the Army before I came here. Using this controller and multiple drones provides me with great visibility in the area around me. This type of technology will be a massive help when rolled out to units in the future, assisting with reconnaissance and the security of specific areas and bases too.”\n“To me personally, I like the fact that you don’t have to walk up a massive hill to see what is happening on the other side. You can just send in the drone to get eyes on which offers less risk to the soldier on the ground.”\n",

In the face of ever-evolving threats to global security, the Defence AI Strategy outlines how the UK will prioritise research, development, and experimentation to revolutionise our Armed Forces capabilities through new concepts and cutting-edge technology to deliver the latest equipment to the battlefield through effective, efficient, trusted pathways. Concepts include AI-enabled autonomous combat vehicles and resupply systems to deliver supplies without putting people in danger, or soldiers on the front-line guided by smart systems drawing on hours of detailed footage captured by a series of small drones. The UK Government also published today its policy on the ‘Ambitious, Safe and Responsible’ use of AI, developed through partnership with the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), including new ethical principles for the use of AI in Defence. These will make sure that defence makes the best and responsible use of the technology, both to retain the confidence of the public and defence partners and to hold others to account for irresponsible behaviours. Defence Procurement Minister, Jeremy Quin, said: \"Future conflicts may be won or lost on the speed and efficacy of AI technology, and our approach to AI must be rapid, ambitious and comprehensive. \"Our new Defence AI Centre (DAIC) and AI strategy will create a focused hub to champion these technologies, working ethically hand in hand with human judgements to maintain the UK’s position at the forefront of global security and responsible innovation.\" Further to this, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) have awarded a ?7 million contract to Northern Ireland based company Kainos, partnering with AI specialist Faculty Science Ltd and defence experts Actica, to deliver world-class artificial intelligence experimentation. The contract will support up to 20 highly skilled data science jobs across the UK as well as developing new specialist roles to reinforce safe, ethical, and operational AI. Dr Paul Kealey, Head of Dstl’s Cyber and Information Systems Division said: \"Dstl is delivering the most ambitious programme in its 20-year history – and we can only deliver on this by working with diverse talent from across industry and academia. \"AI has the potential to provide significant benefits across Defence from the back-office to the Front Line and I’m delighted we are working with Kainos – a brand new supplier who will bring specialist expertise and experience as a leader in the civil world into defence.\" Brendan Mooney, Kainos CEO, said: \"We are delighted to have been selected to be AI Agile Delivery Partner for Dstl. We share the Ministry of Defence’s belief that when utilised effectively and responsibly, data and AI offers unparalleled opportunities for the future of defence. \"Alongside our partners, Faculty and Actica, we are excited by the opportunity to extend this relationship with this long-term engagement with Dstl.\" Defence’s commitment to strengthen security and modernise our armed forces was outlined in the Integrated Review, and the use of AI is a key to achieving that objective. The AI Strategy highlights how the MoD will be transformed into an ‘AI ready’ organisation and in doing so, will support the government’s wider ambitions for the UK to become a Science and Technology Superpower by 2030. The announcements took place during London Tech Week, and the minister made clear at the AI Summit that AI-enabled military capabilities will always be in line with UK ethical values, standards and legal obligations and that there remain instances where human judgement will always be necessary. Building on the Integrated Review and Defence Command Paper - which was backed by an additional ?24 billion for defence over four years - the Defence AI Strategy will form a key element of the National AI Strategy and reinforces defence’s place at the heart of the Government’s drive for strategic advantage through science and technology. ADS Chief Executive, Kevin Craven said: \"Against a clear, current as well as evolving threat landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the global defence and security environment. The Defence Artificial Intelligence Strategy recognises the UK’s potential to be global leaders in science and technology across defence and security. \"We are confident UK industry is capable of meeting the challenges and delivering the strategies’ ambitions and plans. Government and Industry working collaboratively, alongside the new Defence and National Security AI Network and the Defence AI Centre, will advance the development of world-leading AI capability in the UK and enhance our capabilities and our ability to defend our security and deal with these threats.\"\n",

        "原文": "22 September 2022\nA small modular reactor (SMR) could be built in the Czech Republic at the Temelín NPP as early as 2032, Daniel Bene?, the Director of the CEZ power group has said after signing a contract for the establishment of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park. South Bohemian Governor Martin Kuba, addressing an international conference, said: \"We realise that nuclear energy is something that we fundamentally need in the republic. \"Czech industry is not only driven by renewable sources, we are not Norway, which has unlimited water capacities and produces 95% of its energy with clean hydropower plants.\"\nThis is why it was decided to establish the South Bohemian Energy Park, using the Temelin site to build the first SMR in Europe, including an educational centre for engineers, specialists and other technical professions, he added. \"We thus have a unique opportunity to participate in the construction and development of a technical background where experts from all over Europe can be educated.\"\nThe joint company South Bohemia Nuclear Park aims to facilitate construction of the first pilot project at Temelín which offers a protected, research space, and the presence of professional staff to ensure a synergistic effect during planning, construction and operation.\nThis project has the support of the government, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. \"In the context of the situation in Europe, the signing of this agreement is an extremely important step. This is a landmark year, the war in Ukraine shook the international order, tested allied relations and showed the danger of dependence on resources and raw materials from risky countries,\" he noted\n\"Due to supply cuts, we are facing an unprecedented increase in the price of electricity and gas, a situation that threatens us and with which we must deal quickly,” he said. “The government is reacting to it with acute measures, but this is not enough, and that is why we are also working on longer-term solutions that will strengthen our energy security and independence,\" he explained, adding that it also involves building a SMR. \"These are smaller mass-produced devices that largely overcome some of the disadvantages of existing reactors. They could replace ageing power plants and heating plants,\" he concluded.\nBene? emphasised that Temelin is the best possible place for the pilot project. \"At the same time, preparation for the construction of two new standard units continues. We are also working on the project of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany NPP, where we expect offers by the end of November. These buildings are not in competition with the small modular reactors we are talking about.\" He added that SMRs are complementary technologies and are more suitable for a range of different locations. \"Everything is based on the energy mix, the Czech energy mix largely relies on nuclear energy.\"\nIn the last year, the CEZ Group has accelerated activities related to the SMR project, having already signed memorandums of cooperation with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, KHNP and Holtec. Through its subsidiary ?JV Re?, it is also developing SMRs locally. The HeFASTo project or the Energywell project are at an advanced stage of research and intensive cooperation is also underway with Westinghouse.\n\"There are seven companies in the world that deal with the preparation of such projects. We are in very active communication with all of them, we have signed memoranda of cooperation with them. They should put the first installations into operation before 2030. We have a feeling that these technologies will be ground-breaking. It makes sense to build the first pilot project next to the Temelín cooling towers.” He noted that some SMRs are almost as big as the nuclear units in Dukovany, but they are easier and faster to build than large nuclear reactors. He said the SMR in Temelín could be ready between 2032 and 2035.\n\"Given the current situation, we are accelerating this project. We see that it will be necessary to replace a number of coal-fired power plants and heating plants, while maintaining the maximum degree of self-sufficiency,” said Tomá?

South Bohemia's governor Martin Kuba told an international conference that nuclear power was the Czech Republic's most needed source of energy as its water resources were scarce. This is an important reason why the Czech Republic decided to build a nuclear energy park in South Bohemia, using the site of Temelin Nuclear Power Plant to build the first modular small reactor in Europe, including a training and education center. Czech Prime Minister Fiala said that modular small reactors have largely overcome some shortcomings of existing reactors and can replace aging power plants and heating plants. Benes emphasized that Temelin is the best place for the pilot project. Meanwhile, preparations for the construction of two new nuclear power units in Temelin continue. The Czech Republic will also build new units at Dukufani nuclear power plant."

The technique could make it possible to 3D print high-performance blades and vanes for power-generating gas turbines and jet engines, which would enable new designs with improved fuel consumption and energy efficiency.\nToday's gas turbine blades are manufactured through conventional casting processes in which molten metal is poured into complex molds and directionally solidified.

But efforts to 3D-print turbine blades have yet to clear a big hurdle: creep.\nIn metallurgy, creep refers to a metal's tendency to permanently deform in the face of persistent mechanical stress and high temperatures. While researchers have explored printing turbine blades, they have found that the printing process produces fine grains on the order of tens to hundreds of microns in size—a microstructure that is especially vulnerable to creep.\n\"In practice, this would mean a gas turbine would have a shorter life or less fuel efficiency,\" says Zachary Cordero, the Boeing Career Development Professor in Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. \"These are costly, undesirable outcomes.\"\nCordero and his colleagues found a way to improve the structure of 3D-printed alloys by adding an additional heat-treating step, which transforms the as-printed material's fine grains into much larger \"columnar\" grains—a sturdier microstructure that should minimize the material's creep potential, since the \"columns\" are aligned with the axis of greatest stress. The researchers say the method, outlined today in Additive Manufacturing, clears the way for industrial 3D-printing of gas turbine blades.\n\"In the near future, we envision gas turbine manufacturers will print their blades and vanes at large-scale additive manufacturing plants, then post-process them using our heat treatment,\" Cordero says. \"3D-printing will enable new cooling architectures that can improve the thermal efficiency of a turbine, so that it produces the same amount of power while burning less fuel and ultimately emits less carbon dioxide.\"\n",

Based on that, AIP will not be in the LOTE going forward,” said Cdre Phillips.\nHis remarks follow speculation that installing an AIP system would enhance the stealth capabilities of the Collins-class fleet, given the type's range of around 10,000 n miles (18,500 km) and endurance of around 70 days, enabling it to deploy, remain on station, and return from areas of operational interest in Northeast and Southeast Asia.\nThe two-year per boat LOTE activities, scheduled to begin with HMAS Farncomb in 2026, will extend the life of the Collins-class through to 2048, or later if required, prior to the anticipated arrival of nuclear-powered submarines to be acquired via the AUKUS tri-partite security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced in September.\nCaptain Dan LeRaye, Executive Director of the Collins LOTE programme, said during the same conference that hull fatigue studies had shown that the Collins boats, which were commissioned between 1996 and 2003, could achieve the extended operational life required while the new nuclear submarines entered service.\n“If the hull couldn't go the extra distance there was no point in doing life extension,” said the captain. “I know that work was done. I know the answer was favourable and I know the answer was peer-reviewed by both [the US Navy's] NAVSEA [Naval Sea Systems Command], and [Collins designer] Saab Kockums.”\nThe LOTE programme will involve replacing the Collins' diesel generators, main motor, propulsion control switchboard, and power conversion and distribution equipment.

        "原文": "The Australian Labor government announced yesterday that it had finalised agreements with the US government, along with arms manufacturers in that country and in Norway for purchases of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket (HIMARS) system and Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs).\nLabor leaders openly touted the move as an unprecedented expansion of Australia’s aggressive strike capabilities.\nAustralian Labor government announces on January 5, 2023, it will purchased US-made M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) missiles. [AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File]\nSpeaking of the HIMARS, Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy boasted: “We’ll have an Army ground-launched missile that can reach targets up to 300 kilometres away and we’re part of developmental program in the United States called the Precision Strike Missile that’ll allow the Army to hit targets in excess of 499 kilometres.”\n“This will give the Australian army a strike capability they’ve never had before,” Conroy said.\nIn a particularly bellicose comment, Conroy noted: “HIMARS launchers have been successfully deployed by the Ukrainian military over recent months…” The provision of the American system to Ukraine has been one aspect of Washington’s ratcheting up of the US-NATO proxy war in that country against Russia.\nOnly days before Labor’s announcement, US-provided HIMARS were used by Ukrainian forces to carry out a deadly New Year’s Eve strike on a makeshift Russian barracks. The missiles killed between 60 and 400 Russian soldiers, most of them young conscripts.\nLabor’s announcement appeared to be timed to coincide with the news of HIMARS deadly capabilities. Coming at the beginning of the year, the announcement of a new weapons acquisition was also intended to signal the government’s intention to dramatically ramp up a protracted military build-up in 2023.\nIn fact, the HIMARS acquisition has been planned for over six months and is one prong of a far broader program aimed at boosting Australia’s strike capabilities. This is a key component of the US-led drive to militarise the Indo-Pacific region in preparation for an aggressive war against China, aimed at ensuring American global hegemony.\nEven the form of the announcement pointed to that agenda. Conroy and the government have refused to indicate how much the missile systems will cost, only declaring that the price will be between $1 and $2 billion. That is purportedly to limit information about the weapons systems to “potential adversaries.”\nThe acquisition includes 20 of the HIMARS, light rocket launchers that are transportable by truck and other means. An unspecified number of the NSMs are to be purchased. That system can carry a 120-kilogram warhead and strike land and sea targets at a range of 200 to 250 kilometres.\nAccording to Wikipedia: “NSM is able to fly over and around landmasses, travel in sea skim mode, and then make random manoeuvres in the terminal phase, making it harder to stop by enemy countermeasures.”\nThe NSMs are to be placed on the country’s Hobart Class destroyers and Anzac Class frigates. They are clearly offensive weapons, aimed at preparing for aggressive naval operations. Repeatedly, over 2022, it emerged that Australian naval and air forces were participating alongside the US and its other allies in provocative voyages through the South and East China Seas. In several instances, those operations reportedly resulted in “near misses” with Chinese military forces.\nThe HIMARS, as well as other military developments, are being presented by the Labor government and much of the media as a “deterrence.” In this narrative, the supposed purpose is to protect the northern advances of Australia, with hints of a possible attack or even invasion from China in the event of war.\nIn reality, there is no such prospect. Northern Australia is being rapidly militarised to play the role of a “southern anchor” for an aggressive US conflict with China, hosting essential strike capabilities that could be rapidly deployed and would be out of range of most Chinese missiles. Last year, it was revealed, for instance that Labor had agreed to the “rotation” of nuclear-capable US B-52 bombers through the Tindal air base in Australia’s Northern Territory.\nThe exact purpose of the HIMARS remains opaque. At a range of 300 kilometres, stationed in northern Australia they would be able to do little more than fire missiles into the country’s empty coastal waters.\nSeveral hints, however, have been provided. Conroy referenced the potential future ability of HIMARS missiles to travel beyond “499 kilometres.” The number is unusually precise for a reason. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the US and Russia banned land-based missile systems from having a range greater than 500 kilometres.\nThe US, however, scuttled the treaty in 2019. In 2021, it announced a Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) program, which Australia immediately joined, pledging $70 million of an initial $907 million funding. Already in 2021, the Lockheed Martin produced PrSM had exceeded a range of 500 kilometres. Engineers are reportedly seeking to extend that to 1,000 kilometres or more.\nThe plan to acquire the HIMARS has been the subject of discussion in US-aligned pro-war think tanks, even before the previous Liberal-National government first signalled the purchase in May last year.\nSeveral commentaries note, with approval, that the HIMARS is a transportable system. It can be be moved around, not only on army trucks, but also by military planes. An extensive report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in October, already foreshadowed the foreign deployment of the HIMARS.\nIt stated: “The Australian air and sea units at the Butterworth air base and Changi naval base in Singapore require ground protection. To provide that, the Army will need to position forces at each location to work with local forces. The ground force might include HIMARS batteries armed with anti-ship missiles as well as surface-to-air batteries mounting the Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) anti-aircraft system. To safeguard the batteries and the bases from enemy attack, the deployed force will need both mobility and protection.”\nIn other words, there is an active discussion in strategic circles about using the missile system, not only in northern Australia, but throughout the region, to strengthen the US-led confrontation with China.\nThe Labor government has been particularly active, since its election in May, in fighting against supposed Chinese influence in the Pacific and seeking to align the impoverished states there with the anti-China campaign. This included the signing of a defence agreement with Vanuatu last month, providing the Australian military with far-reaching access to that country. It is entirely conceivable that in the coming period, proposals will be raised for the deployment of HIMARS to Vanuatu and other Pacific states, to protect them against “Chinese aggression.”\nAnother commentary, by Martin Davis in the Australian, noted that with PrSM, the striking power of the HIMARS would be “well within the range of a short-range ballistic missile which is a type of capability Australia has never operated before.”\nHe sketched out a scenario, under which: “The application of rapid long-range precision strike against land targets could eventually be matched by developing a maritime-strike variant of PrSM to enable the army to directly contribute to an Australian anti-access and area denial (A2AD) capability as part of an expeditionary operations concept that would see army able to contribute to traditional sea denial missions normally undertaken by the navy.”\nDespite the obscure military jargon, it is clear that Davis is talking about the aggressive naval deployment of the PrSM missiles, for operations throughout the Indo-Pacific.\nNotably, the acquisition has also drawn the attention of the foreign press. The prestigious Times of London published an editorial, headlined: “The Time’s View on Australia’s HIMARS Deal: A Well-Armed Ally.” It declared that the acquisition not only “reinforces the country’s security, but means that it is well placed to thwart Chinese attempts to enforce its regional hegemony or launch a military attack on Taiwan.”\nThe Times also hailed the agreement, as another indication that Australia has decisively aligned with the US war drive, notwithstanding its substantial trade ties with China.\nThe HIMARS announcement is just the first of many to follow over the coming months. In March, a Labor initiated review into defence capabilities will be finalised. An interim report reportedly called for a vast increase in Australia’s missile capabilities, as well as the development of a new fleet of fighter jets. Under the AUKUS pact with the US and Britain, Australia is also acquiring nuclear-powered submarines and next-generation hypersonic missiles.\n",

        "原文": "When you pick up a balloon, the pressure to keep hold of it is different from what you would exert to grasp a jar. And now engineers at MIT and elsewhere have a way to precisely measure and map such subtleties of tactile dexterity.\nThe team has designed a new touch-sensing glove that can \"feel\" pressure and other tactile stimuli. The inside of the glove is threaded with a system of sensors that detects, measures, and maps small changes in pressure across the glove. The individual sensors are highly attuned and can pick up very weak vibrations across the skin, such as from a person's pulse.\nWhen subjects wore the glove while picking up a balloon versus a beaker, the sensors generated pressure maps specific to each task. Holding a balloon produced a relatively even pressure signal across the entire palm, while grasping a beaker created stronger pressure at the fingertips.\nThe researchers say the tactile glove could help to retrain motor function and coordination in people who have suffered a stroke or other fine motor condition. The glove might also be adapted to augment virtual reality and gaming experiences. The team envisions integrating the pressure sensors not only into tactile gloves but also into flexible adhesives to track pulse, blood pressure, and other vital signs more accurately than smart watches and other wearable monitors.\n\"The simplicity and reliability of our sensing structure holds great promise for a diversity of health care applications, such as pulse detection and recovering the sensory capability in patients with tactile dysfunction,\" says Nicholas Fang, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.\nFang and his collaborators detail their results in a study appearing today in Nature Communications. The study's co-authors include Huifeng Du and Liu Wang at MIT, along with professor Chuanfei Guo's group at the Southern University of of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in China.\nSensing with sweat\nThe glove's pressure sensors are similar in principle to sensors that measure humidity. These sensors, found in HVAC systems, refrigerators, and weather stations, are designed as small capacitors, with two electrodes, or metal plates, sandwiching a rubbery \"dielectric\" material that shuttles electric charges between the two electrodes.\nIn humid conditions, the dielectric layer acts as a sponge to soak up charged ions from surrounding moisture. This addition of ions changes the capacitance, or amount of charge between the electrodes, in a way that can be quantified and converted to a measurement of humidity.\nIn recent years, researchers have adapted this capacitive sandwich structure for the design of thin, flexible pressure sensors. The idea is similar: When a sensor is squeezed, the balance of charges in its dielectric layer shifts, in a way that can be measured and converted to pressure. But the dielectric layer in most pressure sensors is relatively bulky, limiting their sensitivity.\nFor their new tactile sensors, the MIT and SUSTech team did away with the conventional dielectric layer in favor of a surprising ingredient: human sweat. As sweat naturally contains ions such as sodium and chloride, they reasoned that these ions could serve as dielectric stand-ins. Rather than a sandwich structure, they envisioned two thin, flat electrodes, placed on the skin to form a circuit with a certain capacitance. If pressure was applied to one \"sensing\" electrode, ions from the skin's natural moisture would accumulate on the underside, and change the capacitance between both electrodes, by an amount that they could measure.\nThey found they could boost the sensing electrode's sensitivity by covering its underside with a forest of tiny, bendy, conductive hairs. Each hair would serve as a microscopic extension of the main electrode, such that, if pressure were applied to, say, a corner of the electrode, the hairs in that specific region would bend in response, and accumulate ions from the skin, the degree and location of which could be precisely measured and mapped.\nPressure pillars\nIn their new study, the team fabricated thin, kernel-sized sensing electrodes lined with thousands of gold microscopic filaments, or \"micropillars.\" They demonstrated that they could accurately measure the degree to which groups of micropillars bent in response to various forces and pressures. When they placed a sensing electrode and a control electrode onto a volunteer's fingertip, they found the structure was highly sensitive. The sensors were able to pick up subtle phases in the person's pulse, such as different peaks in the same cycle. They could also keep up accurate pulse readings, even as the person wearing the sensors waved their hands as they walked across a room.\n\"Pulse is a mechanical vibration that can also cause deformation of the skin, which we can't feel, but the pillars can pick up,\" Fang says.\nThe researchers then applied the concepts of their new, micropillared pressure sensor to the design of a highly sensitive tactile glove. They started with a silk glove, which the team purchased off the shelf. To make pressure sensors, they cut out small squares from carbon cloth, a textile that is composed of many thin filaments similar to micropillars.\nThey turned each cloth square into a sensing electrode by spraying it with gold, a naturally conductive metal. They then glued the cloth electrodes to various parts of the glove's inner lining, including the fingertips and palms, and threaded conductive fibers throughout the glove to connect each electrode to the glove's wrist, where the researchers glued a control electrode.\nSeveral volunteers took turns wearing the tactile glove and performing various tasks, including holding a balloon and gripping a glass beaker. The team collected readings from each sensor to create a pressure map across the glove during each task. The maps revealed distinct and detailed patterns of pressure generated during each task.\nThe team plans to use the glove to identify pressure patterns for other tasks, such as writing with a pen and handling other household objects. Ultimately, they envision such tactile aids could help patients with motor dysfunction to calibrate and strengthen their hand dexterity and grip.\n\"Some fine motor skills require not only knowing how to handle objects, but also how much force should be exerted,\" Fang says. \"This glove could provide us more accurate measurements of gripping force for control groups versus patients recovering from stroke or other neurological conditions. This could increase our understanding, and enable control.\"\n",

The MK-60 Patrol Coastal Griffin Missile System was integrated on a Cyclone-class patrol ship, which used it to hit remote-controlled boats simulating a threat to the ship. U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) conducted a previous Griffin guided-missile system live fire exercise in the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations in December 2019. The system was installed on all forward-deployed patrol coastal ships in 2013.\nThe AGM-176 Griffin is a lightweight, precision-guided munition developed by Raytheon. It can be launched from the ground or air as a rocket-powered missile or dropped from the air as a guided bomb. It carries a relatively small warhead, and was designed to be a precision low-collateral damage weapon for irregular warfare. In September 2013, Raytheon and the U.S. Navy demonstrated the Griffin missile’s ability to engage fast-moving small boats from various platforms throughout a series of at-sea tests. The MK-60 Patrol Coastal Griffin Missile System achieved initial operational capability (IOC) with the U.S. Navy in March 2014.\nAdvertisement\nUS Navy Patrol Coastal Ships Conducts Live Fire Exercise with MK-60 Griffin Missiles in Persian Gulf\nThe MK-60 includes the Griffin missile, a laser targeting system, a launcher, and a battle management system. Each Mk-60 can launch four missiles, and a patrol ship has two MK-60 launchers on board. The U.S. Navy began installing Griffin missiles on Patrol Craft in 2013; as of May 2014, four were outfitted with Griffin missile systems, with plans to equip ten PCs by 2016. When mounted on a ship, the missile is designated the BGM-176B. Arming PCs with Griffin missiles adds a layer of defense to the ships beyond the range of their 25 mm gun mounts, out to 4.5 km (2.8 mi); the missiles’ thrust-vectoring engines can move the missile to its target even when launched vertically.\nExercise participants included patrol coastal ships USS Firebolt (PC 10), USS Thunderbolt (PC 12), USS Tempest (PC 2), USS Chinook (PC 9), USS Hurricane (PC 3), USS Whirlwind (PC 11), expeditionary mobile base platform ship USS Lewis B. Puller (ESB 3) and guided-missile destroyer USS Michael Murphy (DDG 115). Some ships also conducted a live fire exercises with crew-served weapons to maintain operator proficiency and readiness for future missions. The U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations encompasses about 2.5 million square miles of water area and includes the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Red Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean.\nCyclone class Patrol (coastal) ship USS Tempest (PC 2), fires a Griffin Missile during a test and proficiency fire in the Arabian Gulf Nov. 5.

(Kathryn Bailey/U.S. Army)\nBELCAMP, Md. — The coming months will be busy for the U.S. Army’s network modernization office, as it advances a handful of so-called capability sets meant to revamp battlefield communications.\n“As we enter into this fiscal year, it’s probably one of the few times that we’ve had four capability sets kind of going on in parallel,” Program Executive Officer for Command, Control and Communications-TacticalArmy Maj. Gen. Robert Collinssaid at an event March 10.\nThe first capability set — compounding technological improvements implemented every two years — is already about 50% fielded, and will only progress from there, according to Collins.\n“That’s everything from kit that goes down to the brigade combat teams that we’ve done there,” the major general said. “And that does include capability we put out tothe 82nd Airborne, that did deploy.”\nCapability Set ‘21 focused on infantry brigades, making the network more intuitive and making communications gear smaller, lighter and faster.\nA critical design review for Capability Set ‘23, with an eye onStrykersand boosted bandwidth, is planned for April. The upcoming evaluation will really get the ball rolling on procurement — “lock the design and move into the production phase,” said Collins.\n“For Capability Set ‘23, we’ve been doing a lot of experimentation and prototyping as we get ready,” he said. “We had the preliminary design we did last year, we’ve got our critical design that’s coming up.”\nBeyond that,a technical meetingfor Capability Sets ‘25 and ‘27 is planned May 9-10.

And so we do a continuous outreach with industry, and I’m very proud of that.”\nCapability Set ‘25 will build on the two before it and will focus on automation and network protection. By Capability Set ‘27,documents show, the Army’s insertion of commercial capabilities will be “fully institutionalized,” enabling more-secure wireless connectivity, significant cyber improvements and better use of artificial intelligence.\n“On the far righthand side, when we start talking about Capability Set ‘25, we start looking at how do we go from dismounted to mounted?”Collins saidMarch 10. “How do we how do we start to go at echelon?”\n",

But mineral deposits containing neodymium are hard to reach and are found in just a few places on Earth.\nWith rising need for neodymium from several industries, attention has turned to recycling the elements found in old computers and printed circuit boards, otherwise known as electronic waste, to meet demand. But separating the valuable elements from other minerals and components found in e-waste proves to be a challenge.\nIn a recent paper in the Chemical Engineering Journal, Amir Sheikhi, assistant professor of chemical engineering and biomedical engineering, at Penn State, details a new nanotechnology to separate neodymium using plant cellulose, which is found in paper, cotton and pulp. Patrictia Wamea, a former member of Sheikhi's lab who graduated in May with a master of science degree, co-authored the paper and earned the Penn State Department of Chemical Engineering's annual Best Paper Award in fall 2021 for her contributions.\nIn the process, hairy cellulose nanocrystals, nanoparticles derived from cellulose fibrils, bind selectively to neodymium ions, separating them from other ions, such as iron, calcium and sodium, according to Sheikhi. The nanoparticles are known as \"hairy\" due to cellulose chains attached to their two ends, which perform critical chemical functions.\nTo do this, the researchers negatively charged the hairy layers of the nanoparticles in order to attract and bind with the positively charged neodymium ions, resulting in particle aggregation into larger pieces that can then be effectively recycled and reused.\n\"The process is effective in its removal capacity, selectivity and in its speed,\" Sheikhi said. \"It can separate neodymium in seconds by selectively removing the element from some of the tested impurities.\"\nCurrent rare earth element recycling processes are environmentally detrimental, according to Sheikhi. They often use highly acidic conditions to extract the elements in chemical reactions. Sheikhi's process is environmentally friendly due to its use of cellulose, which is an inexpensive renewable resource. The traditional mining process is dangerous and expensive, with harmful environmental impacts from open-pit mining.\n\"Using cellulose as the main agent is a sustainable, cost-effective, clean solution,\" Sheikhi said. \"Using this process, the United States will be able to compete with other giants like China to recover rare earth materials and independently produce them.\"\nChina is the leading exporter of neodymium, according to Sheikhi, exporting more than 70% of the world's supply of the material.\nIn addition to e-waste, rare earth elements like neodymium can be extracted from industrial wastewater, mining tails and permanent magnets that are no longer in use. In the future, Sheikhi said he hopes the cellulose-based adsorption process can be applied to those sources as well.\n\"This contribution to rare earth recycling will have a strategic and economically-viable impact on several industries,\" Sheikhi said. \"The more neodymium we recycle, the more we can manufacture electric and hybrid vehicles and wind turbines, leading to less strain on the environment.\"\n",

        "原文": "Valleytronics is an emerging field in which valleys—local minima in the energy band structure of solids—are used to encode, process, and store quantum information. Though graphene was thought to be unsuitable for valleytronics due to its symmetrical structure, researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India, have recently shown that this is not the case. Their findings may pave the way to small-sized quantum computers that can operate at room temperature.\nFrom the consumer's side, it's pretty easy to notice the giant strides that the field of electronics has made over the past few decades; with wearable gadgets, smart cities, self-driving cars, improved space missions, robots, holography, and supercomputers, the possibilities of technological advancement seem infinite. However, unbeknownst to most people, this accelerated trend of technological advancement fueled by electronics is rapidly coming to a halt as electronic components reach their practical limits. If we are to keep improving our computing power and capacity, we will need to find new ways to store and process data beyond the simple flow and charge of electrons, which is how modern electronics operates.\nSo quantum computers have recently become a hot topic. By encoding information in quantum phenomena, quantum computers transcend the binary notion of each bit being either \"0\" or \"1.\" Instead, quantum bits exist as superpositions of \"0\" and \"1\" and can therefore take intermediate values. By exploiting superpositions through carefully designed algorithms, quantum computers could theoretically outperform conventional computers by several orders of magnitude in terms of speed. Sadly, it has proven difficult to find suitable quantum phenomena to encode information at room temperature. Existing computers, such as those owned by Google, IBM, and Microsoft, have to be kept at ultralow temperatures below –196.1 degrees Celsius, which makes them costly and impractical to operate.\nFortunately, there is a very promising approach for encoding quantum information that is actively being explored: valleytronics. Aside from their charge, electrons have another parameter that can be manipulated, namely their \"valley pseudospin,\" which is the valley that the electron occupies. These so-called valleys are local minima in the energy bands of solids, which dictate the energetic state and location of electrons. Valleys, with their occupation state governed by quantum mechanics, can be used to encode, process, and store quantum information at less restrictive temperatures.\nRecently, a team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India, and Max-Born Institut, Germany, achieved a breakthrough in the field of valleytronics. In their latest study, published in Optica, they present a way to perform valley operations in monolayer or pristine graphene, which was assumed to be impossible by other researchers in the field. As the poster child of carbon nanomaterials, graphene is made from carbon atoms in a hexagonal pattern and bears a plethora of favorable properties. Atomically thin layers of graphene have electron valleys but, due to the material's inherent symmetry, they were deemed useless for valley operations.\nDespite the odds, the team came up with a strategy to break graphene's valley symmetry using light. Associate Professor Gopal Dixit from IIT Bombay, who led the study, explains: \"By tailoring the polarization of two beams of light according to graphene's triangular lattice, we found it possible to break the symmetry between two neighboring carbon atoms and exploit the electronic band structure in the regions close to the valleys, inducing valley polarization.\" In other words, this enables the use of graphene's valleys to effectively \"write\" information. Dr. Dixit also highlights that the flashes of light can cause electrons to wiggle several hundred trillion times a second. In theory, this means valleytronics at petahertz rates is possible, which exceeds modern computational speeds by a million times.\nOne of the most attractive aspects of conducting valley operations in graphene is that it's possible to do so at room temperature. \"Our work could open the door to miniature, general-purpose quantum computers that can be used by regular people, much like laptops,\" remarks Dr. Dixit. With the higher computational speeds provided by quantum computers, it will be much quicker to perform molecular simulations, big data analysis, deep learning, and other computationally intensive tasks. In turn, this will accelerate the development of new drugs and the elucidation of molecular structures, which will help in the search for cures to complex diseases including COVID-19.\n",

Collectively, they represent a key component of EU defense aspirations, though fielding any usable equipment as a result is still years away.\nA new Strategic Air Transport for Outsized Cargo project aims to field a common aircraft fleet for long-haul cargo flights, filling a perennial shortage among European NATO members. The project, which is open for “possible third-state participation,” counts Germany, the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia as its members.\nThe reference to so-called third states is a hint to non-EU countries — likely the United Kingdom or Norway — that they could play a role in the effort if they want. The idea is to identify a “common European solution for the transport of outsized cargo” by 2023, with a separate, follow-on project in 2026 to work toward actual equipment, according to a fact sheet published online by the European Defence Agency.\nEstonia, France and Latvia are banding together on a “semi-autonomous” and optionally manned naval vessel that could be used for reconnaissance, hunting submarines and surface ships, and laying mines. For this project, initial capabilities are already drafted, and companies are looking for ways to form a consortium, according to the EDA statement.\nA “next-generation” small drone sporting a weight of 150 kilograms is the aim of another new project, which aims to deliver an initial prototype by 2026. The craft is meant to be runway-independent, highly deployable, multirole and “tactical,” though official statements leave open what exactly that means.\nGermany, as one of the project members besides Spain, Portugal and Slovenia, has been reluctant to admit the use of armed drones for its forces, though the incoming government has reportedly indicated their use could be permissible under strict self-defense conditions.\nUnder the banner “Defense of Space Assets,” six nations will endeavor to inject survivability considerations into the space programs of EU members states, as satellites vital for military operations on Earth are increasingly becoming targets for would-be adversaries.\nThe project entails a “three-step approach combining training for space military operations, space resilience and access to space and in-space maneuverability,” the EDA statement read. France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Austria are listed as project members so far.\nAside from approving new initiatives, officials this week also adopted recommendations aimed at monitoring progress in the PESCO projects, according to the European Council website.

        "原文": "Jan. 13, 2022 | ByAmanda Miller\nMaturing nuclear thermal propulsion to maneuver satellites out of the way of attacks could also keep the U.S. apace with Chinese and Russian advancements, according to a new paper.\nIn the policy paper“Maneuver Warfare in Space: The Strategic Mandate for Nuclear Propulsion,”the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies argues that new nuclear engines are at least as safe as today’s chemical propulsion while more faster and more fuel efficient.\n“In either case, the impact on our national security from not operationalizing this technology is far greater than the safety and environmental concerns that have been solved thanks to decades of research and testing,” writes author Christopher Stone, senior fellow for space studies in the institute’s Spacepower Advantage Center of Excellence.\nStone, in a briefing with reporters Jan. 13, pegged safety fears inspired by Chernobyl-like disasters as the likeliest barrier to speeding up the development of space nuclear propulsion. But the nuclear thermal systems in question—unlike their chemical counterparts—don’t even involve combustion but instead heat up hydrogen gas.\nOn the other hand, the technology could unlock the ability for the military to move satellites rapidly between Earth orbits or out to cislunar space and back versus staying limited to predetermined orbits and station-keeping-type maneuvers for slight corrections. Considering how little fuel satellites have onboard, defensive maneuvering could amount to “bleeding out propellant,” Stone said.\nWith longer, more fuel-efficient run times than chemical engines and lower mass, nuclear thermal-powered vehicles “can achieve higher velocities, hence shorter flight times,” Stone writes.\nUnderlying much of the military’s space planning—itsnew point of viewof space as a “warfighting domain”—is the fact that its existing satellites probably couldn’t withstand or avoidan attacksuch as by a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon to knock it to pieces or an in-space laser to confound its optics.Russia testedan anti-satellite weapon by destroying a defunct Soviet satellite in November 2021.\nStone said the people who designed today’s satellites weren’t thinking defensively.\n“The situation is now radically different,” he writes. “China has already shifted to a strategy of maneuver warfare in space that leverages space-based and ground-based weapons systems”—and by 2040, they expect that architecture to include satellites with nuclear thermal propulsion.\n“Do we want to be behind the power curve?” Stone said.\nThe paper says the U.S. should:\n“Rapidly adopt a new space force design capable of decisive maneuver warfare in space.” Develop and field nuclear thermal propulsion in partnership with NASA and the Department of Energy. Advance the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’sDRACO program—Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations—from science and technology development to a program of record. DRACO’s low enriched uranium requires less oversight to launch (the President doesn’t have to sign off) than high enriched uranium. “Deploy ground-based and space-based kinetic ASAT weapons systems capable of holding Chinese and Russian targets at risk. … DOD could achieve this objective by repurposing existing initiatives, including its standard missile and ground based mid-course missile defense interceptor programs.” “Hedge against risk by deploying the [Mission Extension Vehicle] to provide GPS and other vital satellite constellations the ability to conduct limited defensive maneuvers while preserving their onboard chemical propellant.” \nThe paper says the Space Force, in particular, should “educate the public and Congress on the growing threat to U.S. space systems and the need to create a more robust force design that will enhance deterrence.”\n",
        "中文原文": "阿曼达·米勒2022年1月13日根据一篇新的论文，成熟的核热推进技术可以使卫星免受攻击，这也可以让美国跟上中国和俄罗斯的进步。在政策文件《太空机动战：核推进的战略任务》中，米切尔航空航天研究所认为，新的核发动机至少与今天的化学推进一样安全，同时更快、更省油。该研究所太空动力优势卓越中心的空间研究高级研究员、作者克里斯托弗·斯通（Christopher Stone）写道：“无论是哪种情况，不实施这项技术对我们国家安全的影响都远远大于通过几十年的研究和测试已经解决的安全和环境问题。”斯通在1月13日对记者的简报中，将切尔诺贝利灾难引发的安全担忧视为加快太空核推进发展的最有可能的障碍。但与化学系统不同，核热系统甚至不涉及燃烧，而是加热氢气。另一方面，这项技术可以为军方释放能力，使其能够在地球轨道之间快速移动卫星，或者将卫星移出到卫星空间，然后返回，而不是停留在预定的轨道上，进行微小的修正，并进行保持站式的机动。斯通说，考虑到卫星上的燃料很少，防御性机动可能相当于“耗尽推进剂”。由于比化学发动机运行时间更长、更省油、质量更低，核热动力汽车“可以获得更高的速度，因此飞行时间更短，”斯通写道。军方太空规划的大部分内容--它将太空视为“战争领域”的新观点--是这样一个事实，即其现有的卫星可能无法承受或避免攻击，如直接上升的反卫星武器将其击成碎片，或太空激光将其光学混淆。2021年11月，俄罗斯通过摧毁一颗废弃的苏联卫星来测试反卫星武器。斯通说，设计今天卫星的人没有进行防御性思考。“现在的情况完全不同了，”他写道。“中国已经转向利用天基和地基武器系统的太空机动战战略”--到2040年，他们预计该架构将包括带有核热推进的卫星。“我们想落后于权力曲线吗？”斯通说。该报称，美国应该：“迅速采用一种新的太空部队设计，能够在太空中进行决定性的机动作战。”与美国宇航局和能源部合作开发和应用核热推进技术。将国防高级研究计划局的德拉科项目--敏捷Cislunar操作的示范火箭--从科学和技术发展推进到一个有记录的项目。德拉科的低浓缩铀发射需要的监督比高浓缩铀少（总统不必签字）。“部署能够将中国和俄罗斯目标置于危险之中的陆基和天基动能反卫星武器系统。……国防部可以通过重新利用现有的举措来实现这一目标，包括其标准导弹和陆基中段导弹防御拦截器计划。“通过部署[任务扩展飞行器]来对冲风险，为全球定位系统和其他重要的卫星星座提供进行有限防御演习的能力，同时保留其机载化学推进剂。”该报称，太空部队尤其应该“教育公众和国会，让他们认识到美国太空系统面临的日益增长的威胁，以及创建一个更强大的部队设计以增强威慑力的必要性。”",

        "原文": "Presenting his company’s third-quarter results on 29 October, Safran chief executive Olivier Andries uttered a warning that was likely all-too familiar to his fellow aerospace leaders.\nThe industry’s supply chain, said Andries, has become “fragile” over the course of the coronavirus pandemic as rapid and steep production cuts cascaded down from the airframers and tier one suppliers.\nAnd now the industry is looking to reverse course and increase production again, shortages may hinder that plan. Andries notes “concerns about human resources”, which are “even more acute in the USA”, alongside “tensions in raw material availability”, citing chemicals and metals such as aluminium as particular pinch-points.\n“These are specific concerns that we will have to address because they are a challenge for the ramp-up… across the supply chain widely,” he says.\nWhile Andries stresses that Safran is managing the situation, his comments, and those from industry peers at Airbus, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and others, represent the first trillings of the sector’s alarm bells.\nAirbus, for example, has had to postpone the delivery of some aircraft which have been through the assembly line but lack certain components.\n“We all observe tension in the supply chain after 15 months of stable rates. We’re now in a ramp-up – we see all the difficulties to go from ‘hibernation’ back to business,” says chief executive Guillaume Faury.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, low production rates mean the problem has yet to affect Boeing in the same way, but that does not mean it is not a concern.\n“By the second half of next year, our industry will be supply constrained,” warns Boeing chief executive David Calhoun. “Raw materials, logistics and labour availability will also be key watch items for future rate increases.”\nAnd lest it be seen as a challenge solely for a commercial aerospace industry that rapidly contracted and is now seeking to quickly bounce back, Lockheed too has said it is not immune to supply chain constraints, not least that a swathe of its suppliers are equally exposed to the fortunes of the civil market.\nExplaining Lockheed’s rapid payment terms – which enhance the cash-flow of its subcontractors - acting chief financial officer John Mollard notes: “We need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful.”\nAlex Krutz, managing director of aerospace and defence advisory firm Patriot Industrial Partners, says on the materials side, the supply issues are manifesting themselves in a variety of ways.\nOn the one hand, there are genuine shortages of metals such as titanium and Inconel – a family of high-temperature alloys – and on the other, there is a lack of capacity for special processes and coatings.\n“When Covid struck, a lot of these mills either shut down or allocated their lines to other industrial products that weren’t as impacted. To bring those mills and those fabrication lines [back] is slow,” says Krutz.\nAs a result, some aerospace suppliers have had to stretch their lead times. What used to take 24 weeks – from ordering raw materials to delivery of a finished product – might now take 32 weeks.\nExacerbating this situation is the fact that smaller tier three and four supplies – those with annual revenue in the $10-15 million bracket – are no longer there, casualties of the pandemic. Although bigger companies are now seeking new suppliers, that process takes time.\nWhile there may be troubles unique to aerospace, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia points out that many of its problems are “dismally familiar to all sectors of the economy”.\nHe cites a range of causes, from “high levels of demand for most goods, which surprised businesses that were prepared for a downturn and contracted when they should have expanded; infrastructure bottlenecks, container shortages, and of course pandemic-related border closures, and factory closures too.”\nMeanwhile, as the industry grapples with parts or materials shortages, it is simultaneously addressing a tightening of the labour market.\n“We do hear from the supply chain difficulty in hiring. Employees are getting lured away by higher pay in other sectors or those with less volatility,” says Ferguson. However, he stresses that with production rates still well below those seen pre-pandemic “it isn’t hurting as much”.\nWhether that situation develops into a labour crisis though will depend on how the vaccine mandates play out, particularly in the USA where large chunks of the population are opposed to the concept.\nBecause most aerospace manufacturers are US government contractors, they are subject to the federal requirement that all employees are inoculated against Covid-19 by a deadline of 8 December.\nIt is unclear whether workers will follow through on threats to leave – or be fired – due to vaccine intransigence, but there is potential for future disruption, at least in the short term.\n",

During the COVID-19 outbreak, the supply chain of aerospace industry became \"fragile\" as aircraft manufacturers and primary suppliers quickly and drastically reduced production.Now, the aerospace industry is looking to reverse the direction and increase production again, but supply chain shortages may hinder this plan. Andres cited \"human resource concerns,\" which are \"even more serious in the U.S.,\" as well as a \"tight supply of raw materials,\" citing chemicals and metals such as aluminum as particularly thorny issues.Although Andres stressed Safran was in control, his comments, as well as those of counterparts at Airbus, Boeing, Loma, Raytheon and others, have repeatedly sounded alarm bells.Airbus, for example, had to delay deliveries of aircraft that had been assembled but lacked some parts. \"We have all observed strains in the supply chain after 15 months of steady state. We are now in an upward phase-we have seen all the difficulties of returning to the market from'hibernation ',\" said Guillaume Fury, Airbus chief executive.Boeing's low productivity means the problem has not yet affected Boeing in the same way, but that does not mean it is not a problem.\"By the second half of 2022, our industry will be subject to supply constraints,\" Boeing CEO David Calhoun warned. \"Raw materials, logistics and labor supply will also be key observation items for future interest rate hikes.\"This is not just a challenge for the civil aviation and aerospace industry (which is shrinking rapidly and is now seeking a rapid rebound). Loma said that it is not immune to the constraints of the supply chain, especially because a series of its suppliers are also facing the fate of the civilian market. \"We need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful,\" Acting CFO John Mourard noted in explaining Loma's quick payment terms.Alex Cruz, managing director of aerospace and defense consultancy Patriot Industrial Partners, says when it comes to materials, supply problems manifest themselves in various ways.On the one hand, there is a real shortage of metals such as titanium and Cr-Ni-Fe (a family of superalloys), and on the other hand, there is a lack of special process and coating ability.\"When the COVID-19 outbreak broke out, many such factories either closed or allocated their production lines to other industrial products that were not equally affected. It is slow to recover these factories and production lines,\" Cruz said.As a result, some aerospace suppliers have to extend the delivery cycle. It used to take 24 weeks-from ordering raw materials to delivering finished products-and now it may take 32 weeks.This is compounded by the fact that smaller Tier 3 and Tier 4 suppliers (with annual revenues of between $10 million and $15 million) have ceased to exist, which is a loss caused by the epidemic. Although larger companies are now looking for new suppliers, the process will take time.Although there may be unique problems in the aerospace field, Tier Group analyst Richard Abrafia pointed out that many problems in the aerospace field are \"well known to all economic sectors\".He cited a range of reasons, from \"high levels of demand for most goods during the pandemic that surprised businesses braced for recession and contracted at a time when they were supposed to expand; infrastructure bottlenecks, container shortages, and of course border closures related to the pandemic, and factory closures.\"While the aerospace industry is struggling to cope with the shortage of parts or materials, it is also dealing with the contraction of the labor market. Employees are attracted by high salaries in other industries or less volatile ones, but with productivity still well below pre-pandemic levels, the labour squeeze has not had much impact.Whether that develops into a labor crisis, however, will depend on the outcome of vaccinations, especially in the United States, where most people oppose vaccines.Since most aerospace manufacturers are U.S. government contractors, all employees must be vaccinated by Dec. 8, as required by the federal government.It is unclear whether workers will continue to face the threat of leaving-or being laid off-due to intransigence over vaccinations, but there could be chaos ahead, at least in the short term."

        "原文": "By THERESA HITCHENSon November 29, 2022 at 2:28 PM\nWASHINGTON — US Space Command already is eyeing further streamlining once itsjust-announced reorganizationsettles into place, including a move to merge two of its operational centers, according to SPACECOM chief Gen. Jim Dickinson.\n“Those are things that we’re looking at right now,” he told the Mitchell Institute in an online talk today.\nSPACECOM on Nov. 15 announced it had created a new headquarters structure, called theCombined Joint Task Force-Space Operations (CJTF-SO), to oversee those two commands responsible for day-to-day operations: theJoint Task Force-Space Defense(JTF-SD) and theCombined Force Space Component Command (CFSCC).\nThe JTF-SD, headquartered at Schriever SFB, Colo., is responsible for protecting and defending US space assets, including those belonging to the Intelligence Community via the bilateralNational Space Defense Center. The CFSCC, headquartered at Vandenberg SFB, Ca., takes care of space support functions for military operators, such as managing access to communications satellites and operating the GPS constellation. It is called a “combined force” command because it includes allied representatives.\nThe establishment of the CJTF-SO headquarters structure, Dickinson explained, was aimed at providing more “agility” and “flexibility” in decision-making than the old structure, which saw the leaders of both sub-commands reporting directly to him and SPACECOM headquarters staff.\nThe reorganization also means SPACECOM “will be able to synchronize both what we do from a space-enabling perspective as well as what we do for protect and defend on orbit,” and to avoid potential overlaps between those two inter-related missions, he said.\n“And so the purpose of CJTF-SO, as most higher headquarters, will be the synchronization of those missions and synchronization of those resources,” Dickinson said.\nAs a first step, he said, the new CJTF-SO headquarters staff is working now to establish “its functions and roles and missions,” leading up to a SPACECOM declaration of initial operational capability (IOC).\nBut Dickinson suggested SPACECOM wanted to see if it could go further to streamline that decision-making structure, by looking at “whether or not we need two command centers, whether they could be one — I mean, those are all options that we’re looking at right now,” he added.\nA SPACECOM spokesperson later in the day clarified that Dickinson was talking about two of the handful of operations centers that ultimately report up to him, rather than to overarching subordinate commands.\n“Gen. Dickinson was referencing a number of options the command is considering to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. When asked directly about any potential further consolidation, his response was referring to two of the operational centers within the command, not the operational commands themselves, as one of many options,” the spokesperson said in an email to Breaking Defense.\nDickinson also praised the Space Force’sNov. 23 standupof a new service component command at US Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii.\n“I believe that’s the right place at the right time for that element to stand up,” he said.\nIn response to questions about how the INDOPACOM Space Force component — and by implication future planned service components at other combatant commands — will work with SPACECOM’s own regionally embeddedJoint Integrated Space Teams, Dickinson expressed no concerns about possible crossed wires.\nThe Space Force is a military service with the mission to organize, train and equip forces for operational combatant commands, of which SPACECOM is one. SPACECOM, which is both a geographical and a functional command, is responsible for ensuring other combatant commands are being provided necessary space capabilities to do their warfighting jobs, and that SPACECOM operators are responding to theater needs.\nFor example, Dickinson waived away the specter that the Space Force component might inject an additional layer of decision-making bureaucracy into the process for providing space capabilities to warfighters in the field.\n“There won’t be an additional layer,” he said. The Space Force component’s creation “is actually enhancing the relationship, if you will, between INDOPACOM and US Space Command,” he said.\nDickinson explained that all the other services have component commands at INDOPACOM — just as they do at all six other geographic combatant commands — and that the Space Force’s component will work in the same traditional way.\n“So, the INDOPACOM commander will look to that … space service component for all things space, if you will, in terms of support of his operations in his respective AOR [area of operations],” he said. “What will happen at that point will be the normal integration and coordination that would happen — that has happened [and] is happening right now — between that component and US Space Command in terms of making sure that we provide the space enabling capabilities that the INDOPACOM commander needs in support of his operations.”\nThe Guardians making up the service component command “work directly for the INDOPACOM commander, but there is a coordination relationship that already exists” with SPACECOM via the CFSCC, Dickinson added.\nThe CFSCC “executes tactical control over globally dispersed Air Force, Army, and Navy space [and now Space Force] units that command ground-based space capabilities and satellites in every orbital regime,” SPACECOM’swebsiteexplains.\nIn fact, Dickinson elaborated, Space Force created the new component by assigning to it Guardians already at INDOPACOM and familiar with the coordination process.\n“So, that relationship already exists and will continue to exist,” he said, and “will mature.”\n",

        "原文": "Researchers from MSU and Skoltech have transmuted a pesky poisonous weed into high-grade anode material for sodium-ion batteries. These are an emerging cheaper alternative to lithium-ion batteries for uses where compact size is not crucial, such as on solar and wind farms. The study was published in Batteries.\n\"We thought, wouldn't it be fun to take something as nasty and objectionable as hogweed and make something useful out of it,\" study co-author Zoya Bobyleva of Lomonosov Moscow State University commented. \"The thing about hard carbon materials, used in sodium-ion battery anodes, is you can make them from biomass of virtually any origin. No one has considered hogweed before. But it turned out pretty well.\"\nSosnowsky's hogweed is an invasive plant that causes severe skin burns. Originally imported to central Russia from Caucasus as an experimental forage crop, it quickly got out of control and, according to forecasts by Skoltech researchers, is threatening to spread over the entire European part of the country by the mid-21st century.\nSodium-ion batteries are an alternative technology for power storage that avoids using lithium, which is largely concentrated in a select few countries, is becoming increasingly expensive, and is not environmentally friendly in production. If a battery uses sodium ions instead of lithium ions, however, completely different materials have to be used in the cathode and anode. Not long ago, Skoltech researchers proposed a cathode material with outstanding properties. This time, another research group based at the Institute and MSU, came up with a high-quality anode material derived from a fairly unlikely source.\n\"As of today, hard carbon offers the best combination of properties for a sodium-ion battery anode. It's an amorphous form of carbon that does not transform into graphite even when exposed to very high temperatures. Unlike graphite, its structure can accommodate sodium ions and release them over many cycles, which is crucial for battery operation, and it does not significantly expand in size upon charge-up. It is also cheap, reasonably easy to synthesize and dispose of, and does not create significant fire hazards. The two key figures of merit here are Coulombic efficiency and energy storage capacity,\" the study's principal investigator, Professor Evgeny Antipov of Skoltech and MSU, said.\nThe hard carbon produced by the MSU-Skoltech team exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of 87%, which is on par with the best reported results for hard carbons synthesized from other raw materials. That characteristic reflects how well a material stores energy without wasting it on unwanted irreversible secondary processes that actually harm the battery. As for the energy storage capacity, at about 260 mAh/g, the material falls short of the best results reported elsewhere—around 300 mAh/g—but is still reasonably good.\n\"In fact, we considered both winter hogweed, which is safe for harvesting, and the nasty summer hogweed in full bloom. Hate to tell you, but the specimens gathered in the summer proved better in terms of the Coulombic efficiency of the end product, which is the characteristic we emphasized in this study, because it tends to be the weak spot of hard carbon anodes. As for the energy storage capacity, there are ways we can probably improve it later on,\" Bobyleva added.\nThe team tested three popular approaches to hard carbon synthesis. First, there's direct carbonization: heating the biomass to 1,300 degrees Celsius in an atmosphere without oxygen. Alternatively, you can treat the biomass with an acid to remove metallic and other impurities prior to carbonization. This approach resulted in a significantly higher Coulombic efficiency. Or you can boil the hogweed biomass in water in a closed reactor—this produces very small carbon-containing spheres. While all three approaches led to comparable energy storage capacity, heat treatment with prior impurity removal resulted in the best Coulombic efficiency.\n\"The demand for rechargeable accumulators will continue to grow. And when it comes to stationary batteries deployed at industrial facilities and in the production of renewable energy to even out fluctuations in available sunlight or wind power, the sodium-ion technology appears very promising. These batteries will be much cheaper, and while they might be heavier and bulkier, it won't be much of a problem for the relevant applications,\" study co-author Professor Artem Abakumov said; he heads the Center for Energy Science and Technology at Skoltech.\n",

The concept, developed by researchers at the Technische Universit?t Dresden (TUD) in Germany, could be applied to cells made from other so-called polymorphic material systems, as well as to other types of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.\nModern solar cells often contain a heterojunction – a structure in which two components with different optoelectronic properties meet at an interface. The properties of these components are usually tuned by using different materials or by doping the same material so that one side of the junction has an excess of electrons (n-doped) while the other has an excess of positively-charged holes (p-doped).\nTwo polymorphs of caesium lead iodide\nResearchers led by Yana Vaynzof have now developed a new type of heterojunction solar cell that uses two polymorphs, or phases, of a single material: caesium lead iodide. This material is a perovskite and highly efficient at absorbing light at wavelengths in the Sun’s spectrum, and the optoelectronic properties of its gamma and beta phases are different. By placing the gamma-perovskite atop the beta-perovskite, the researchers succeeded in fabricating a solar cell that is much more efficient than cells based on single-phase perovskites.\nAccording to Vaynzof and colleagues, who report their work in Nature Energy, the top layer of gamma-perovskite improves the performance of the solar cells by passivating defects at the surface of the bottom beta-phase layer. These defects usually trap photoactivated charge carriers (electrons and holes), preventing them from propagating to the opposite side of the photovoltaic device and producing electric current.\nThe phase heterojunction also increases the cell’s performance in other ways, Vaynzof adds. “Light absorption in the phase heterojunction structure is enhanced as compared to each of the single phases, and the alignment between the energy levels of the two phases results in a beneficial energetic landscape with the solar cell to drive the charge carriers to be separated,” she explains.\n‘An entirely new concept for photovoltaics’\nThe TUD team made its solar cell by depositing the bottom beta-phase and top gamma-phase using techniques called solution processing and thermal evaporation, respectively. Both techniques require only moderate temperatures and combining them produces a sharp interface between the two phases. The phase heterojunction is also stable over long time periods.\n“Considering that phase heterojunction solar cells are an entirely new concept for photovoltaics, we foresee that such a concept may also be applied to other polymorphic materials systems” Vaynzof tells Physics World. “It is also possible that such a concept could be applied to other types of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.”\nThe researchers are now exploring different phase heterojunction configurations for other perovskite compositions. They are also exploring alternative photovoltaic device architectures. “Importantly, we aim to use only thermal evaporation as the deposition method to enable the fabrication of multi-layered structures without the limitations that arise from the use of solvents in solution processing,” Vaynzof says. “Since thermal evaporation is a highly scalable, industrially-relevant method, this will facilitate the future integration of phase heterojunctions in industrial applications.”\n",

        "原文": "20 September 2022\nFrom Brian Jones, NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support\nNORFOLK, Va. - Additive Manufacturing, more commonly known as 3D printing, is becoming a popular solution in industrial settings. But when it comes to military application, there was no business model to help determine return on investment until the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Navy Price Fighters (NPF) developed the Additive Manufacturing Cost and Time (AMCAT) decision tool.\nThe NPF were tasked in October 2016 to develop a means to determine a business case for Additive Manufacturing. They reviewed numerous articles, industry publications, and Department of Defense guidance regarding AM and discovered there wasn’t a consistent path for determining a business case for AM.\n“Even though AM has been around for a while, it’s still relatively new for the Department of Defense and the Navy,” said William Peterson, NAVSUP WSS NPF Operations Research Analyst and AMCAT Team Lead. “There’s a lot of information out there on where additive manufacturing can best be used and what the benefits are, but there’s no agreement on what metrics need to be collected to determine a business case or the cost of additive manufacturing.”\nThe NPF quickly realized in order to determine a viable business case they had to collect data to help calculate both AM cost and time, as well as, determine viable results for an AM business case.\n“We needed to decide as a group what data we needed to collect in order to come up with additive manufacturing cost,” said Peterson. “The ultimate goal of the tool is to determine whether it’s more cost effective to use additive manufacturing or to use established supply systems.”\nThe NPFs developed the AMCAT web-based tool to provide the information necessary to make an informed value decision. The tool is designed around standard engineering processes accomplished by DoD AM production sites across the United States. AMCAT is a one-of-a-kind analytics tool standardizing the collection of AM data, enabling metric reporting and provides a comparison between AM and traditional supply chain solutions.\n“Currently NAVAIR and NAVSEA are our biggest proponents and have started using the web-based AMCAT, and we continue to gather data,” said Peterson.\nWhile other entities within the DoD are working on similar solutions, the NPFs believe the AMCAT should be accepted as the standard for cost and time modeling as a way to determine return on investment.\n“Our tool captures everything and uses real data for things like non-recurring engineering (labor hours and equipment purchases), shipping, contracting and transportation costs,” said Peterson. “The intention is to capture all of the costs of AM. Our tool is the only one capturing all that data.”\nAs the AMCAT gathers more data, the tool will provide a more accurate business case for the use of additive manufacturing. If the NPFs have their way, the AMCAT will play an integral role in determining the viability of 3D printing decisions across the DoD.\n",

        "原文": "Computers are getting smaller and smaller, just as current cell phones offer computing power similar to that of a laptop. And the trend toward miniaturization continues. Smart dust applications (tiny microelectronic devices), such as biocompatible sensor systems in the body, demand computers and batteries smaller than a dust mote. So far, this development has been hindered by two main factors: lack of on-chip power sources for operation anytime and anywhere and difficulties in producing integrable microbatteries.\nIn the current issue of Advanced Energy Materials, Prof. Dr. Oliver G. Schmidt, head of the Professorship for Material Systems of Nanoelectronics and Scientific Director of the Center for Materials, Architectures and Integration of Nanomembranes (MAIN) at Chemnitz University of Technology, Dr. Minshen Zhu, who has been working in Prof. Schmidt's group at the Research Center MAIN since February 2022, and researchers from Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research (IFW) Dresden and Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry present a solution to these challenges. They discuss how battery-powered smart dust applications can be realized in the sub-millimeter-scale and present the world's smallest battery by far as an application-oriented prototype.\n\"Our results show encouraging energy storage performance at the sub-square-millimeter scale,\" says Dr. Minshen Zhu, and Prof. Oliver Schmidt adds: \"There is still a huge optimization potential for this technology, and we can expect much stronger microbatteries in the future.\"\nBeyond the limits of miniaturization\nThe power to run tiny sub-millimeter-scale computers can be provided by developing appropriate batteries or \"harvesting\" methods to generate electricity.\nIn the area of \"harvesting,\" micro-thermoelectric generators, for example, convert heat to electricity, but their output power is too low to drive dust-sized chips. Mechanical vibrations are another source of energy for powering tiny-scale devices. Small photovoltaic cells that convert light into electrical energy on small chips are also promising.\nHowever, light and vibrations are not available at all times and in all places, making on demand operation impossible in many environments. This is also the case, for example, in the human body, where tiny sensors and actuators require a continuous power supply. Powerful tiny batteries would solve this problem.\nHowever, the production of tiny batteries is very different from their everyday counterparts. For example, compact batteries with high energy density, button cells for instance, are manufactured using wet chemistry. Electrode materials and additives (carbon materials and binders) are processed into a slurry and coated onto a metal foil. On-chip microbatteries produced using such standard technologies can deliver good energy and power density but have a footprint of significantly more than one square millimeter.\nShrinking Tesla technology: Swiss-roll process enables on-chip batteries for dust-sized computers\nStacked thin films, electrode pillars or interdigitated microelectrodes are used for on-chip battery manufacturing. However, these designs often suffer from inferior energy storage, and the footprint of these batteries cannot be reduced significantly below one square millimeter. The goal of Prof. Schmidt, Dr. Zhu and their team members was therefore to design a battery significantly less than one square millimeter across and integrable on a chip, which still has a minimum energy density of 100 microwatt hours per square centimeter.\nTo achieve this, the team winded up current collectors and electrode strips at the microscale—a similar process also used by Tesla on the large scale to manufacture the batteries for its e-cars.\nThe researchers use the so-called \"Swiss-roll\" or \"micro origami\" process. A layered system with inherent tension is created by consecutively coating thin layers of polymeric, metallic and dielectric materials onto a wafer surface. The mechanical tension is released by peeling off the thin layers which then automatically snap back to roll up into a Swiss-Roll architecture. Thus, no external forces are needed to create such a self-wound cylinder micro-battery. The method is compatible with established chip manufacturing technologies and capable of producing high throughput micro-batteries on a wafer surface.\nUsing this method, the research team has produced rechargeable microbatteries that could power the world's smallest computer chips for about ten hours—for example, to measure the local ambient temperature continuously. A tiny battery with great potential for future micro- and nanoelectronic sensorics and actuator technologies in areas such as the Internet of Things, miniaturized medical implants, microrobotic systems and ultra-flexible electronics.\n",

However, due to the gradual difficulty in competing with cheap electricity produced by natural gas and new energy, the US nuclear power industry is facing a wave of outage. The package will be a boon for U.S. nuclear operators such as Southern and Exelon, as well as U.S. uranium miners such as Energy Fuels."

Having greater speed allows the operator to launch more projectiles simultaneously, further enhancing the probability of intercepting incoming missiles.\nA projectile generated a speed of 2,300 meters (7,546 feet) per second during the research phase, nearly 600 meters (1,968 feet) per second faster than current intercept systems, the outlet added.\nMoreover, the system allows speed regulation of the projectiles, letting operators gauge their response according to hypersonic missile barrage intensity.\nDevelopers want to add the railgun to a multi-layered counter-missile system, including long-range missiles, to deter adversaries from launching an attack.\nHypersonic Weapons\nThe development comes as Russia, North Korea, and China have revealed their hypersonic weapon development plans.\nHypersonic weapons travel over five times the speed of sound with an irregular flight path. This renders current countermeasures, developed primarily for ballistic missiles with predictable parabolic flight paths, ineffective.\nMoscow is on the verge ofdeploying its sea-launched hypersonic Zircon missile, while Beijingsurprisedthe world late last year with the reportedlaunch of a hypersonic glide vehicle.\nPyongyang also claimed to have launched such a weapon last September, forcing Tokyo to develop a credible deterrent.\n",

Boeing is responsible for that pod subsystem, which the Air Force said it received in February 2021.\nKent Wood, acting director of AFRL’s directed energy directorate, said in a statement to Breaking Defense that the subsystems delivered under SHiELD “represent the most compact and capable laser weapon technologies delivered to date.”\n“Mission utility analyses and wargaming studies are ongoing, and will help determine how these subsystems and/or an integrated laser weapon system might potentially be used. Specific targets for future tests and demonstrations will be determined by the results of these studies as well,” he continued.\nWith the laser delivered to the Air Force, Griffin said the next step will be to start integrating the weapon itself with the thermal system that manages LANCE’s heating and cooling.\nWhen asked about when the weapon will be fired, Griffin deferred to the Air Force. Wood, the AFRL official, told Breaking Defense the service has not made any final decisions for “follow-on activities.”\n“A variety of potential applications and platforms are being considered for potential demonstrations and tests, in partnership with our warfighter stakeholders,” he said. “At this time, no decision has been made on a specific application or platform for these follow-on activities, no flight demonstration is funded and there is no direct transition plan into a program of record.”\n",

It is part of a broader CNL effort to develop radiopharmaceutical therapies using Actinium-225, a medical isotope produced by CNL.\nAlthough the CNRI programme was originally established in 2019 to advance the deployment of small modular reactor (SMRs) and advanced reactor designs, and was expanded in 2021 to include health sciences. Cooperation with Jubilant is the first project in the new CNRI-H programme, which is designed to accelerate the development of targeted radiopharmaceuticals in Canada through collaborations.\nCNL maintains diverse capabilities in areas of health and dosimetry. These include pre-clinical animal studies, isotope production and processing, in vitro drug evaluation, targeted radionuclide therapies, ISO-accredited analytical chemistry services and waste management solutions. CNL also seeks to establish itself as an international hub in the research, development and supply of next-generation medical isotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, including the extremely rare Actinium-225 isotope that shows great promise as the basis for new, cutting-edge cancer therapies.\nIn recent years, CNL has developed a small scale generator which produces enough Actinium-225 for its own research, but also meaningful quantities that it can share with strategic partners in industry and academia. As part of the collaboration, which is partly funded through in-kind contributions from CNL, Jubilant will make use of Actinium-225 and CNL’s unique expertise, facilities and infrastructure to conduct the necessary pre-clinical research needed to advance its new radiopharmaceutical.\nGeorge Baidoo, CNL’s Technical Director of Health in Business Development noted: “With the support of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), CNL also continues to invest in our pharmaceutical capabilities, facilities, equipment and quality assurance competencies, having recently obtained Good Laboratory Practices certification. Overall, CNL is well positioned to help companies unlock the potential of new nuclear medicine and radiopharmaceuticals.”\nBy leveraging the assets owned by AECL, CNL also serves as the nexus between government, the nuclear industry, the broader private sector and the academic community. CNL works in collaboration with these sectors to advance innovative Canadian products and services towards real-world use, including carbon-free energy, cancer treatments and other therapies, non-proliferation technologies and waste management solutions.\nAt the end of 2022 CNL marked five years since the first successful shipment of Actinium-225, and recently delivered its 100th shipment. Furthermore, CNL has realised steady progress during that same time, including establishing research-scale production facilities at the Chalk River Laboratories campus, implementing international standards to perform pre-clinical research at the site, and securing a global network of partners needed to eventually deliver a stable, commercial supply of the isotope.\nCNL is now working towards bringing in significantly larger quantities of Actinium-225 supplies in order to strengthen the supply chain for the isotope. With this in view, it recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with ITM Isotope Technologies Munich based in Germany. CNL and ITM intend to leverage their capabilities to establish a stable, supply of Actinium-225 for the global market.\n“CNL has been a reliable commercial partner to ITM, providing us with consistent shipments of the highest-quality Actinium-225, which have been used to help advance research needed to unlock the therapeutic potential of this exciting new medical isotope,” commented ITM CEO Steffen Schuster. “Looking to the future, ITM will continue to work together with CNL to accelerate the production and development of Actinium-225, to help bring novel cancer therapies and treatments to the international marketplace.”\nCNL is also leveraging its expertise in radiobiology to conduct research that examines the mechanisms of action of Actinium-225 as a cancer treatment. This includes work as part of AECL’s Federal Nuclear Science & Technology Work Plan.\n",

        "原文": "X-Bow Launch Systems, a space technology 3D printing company, has exited stealth mode this week.\nOriginally founded in 2016, the New Mexico-headquartered startup specializes in the development of 3D printed solid fuels and rocket motors and has already created a lineup of small launch vehicles suitable for both orbital and suborbital launches.\nHaving already secured several contracts with U.S. government organizations, X-Bow’s existing customers include the Air Force Research Lab, AFWERX, Los Alamos National Lab, Sandia National Lab, and the Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\nJason Hundley, CEO of X-Bow, said, “X-Bow is leveraging a unique combination of technologies with an improved manufacturing model to serve existing aerospace markets and enable new ones. Our breakthrough 3D printing technology is positioned to rapidly innovate the solid propulsion and energetics markets just as SpaceX revolutionized the launch market. Our mission is to modernize solid motor production through additive manufacturing while dramatically improving unit economics.”\nSolid fuel rocket engines\nA solid-fuel rocket, as the name might suggest, is a rocket engine that relies on propellants (fuel and oxidizer) that come in solid form. Since the turn of the 20th century, liquid-propelled rockets have proven to be more efficient and controllable, but solid rockets are often still used for military applications due to their simplicity and robustness.\nUnlike their liquid or hybrid counterparts, solid-fuel rockets can be kept in storage for long periods of time without the propellant degrading. As such, they almost always launch reliably but suffer when it comes to fuel efficiency and performance, meaning they’re not the optimal choice for modern medium-to-large launch vehicles. Instead, solid rockets are frequently used as strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity or as light launch vehicles for low Earth orbit (LEO) payloads.\nX-Bow’s 3D printed solid rocket motors\nSince its inception, X-Bow has focused on designing and 3D printing its own solid rocket motors. The firm claims that its launch vehicles are both more efficient and more cost-effective than traditional rocket engines, reportedly bridging flexibility, reliability, and responsiveness.\nOver the past six years, X-Bow has crafted itself an ever-growing product line comprising 3D printed rocket engines, additively manufactured propellants, and end-to-end launch services for a range of government and commercial clients. The company boasts a workforce of over 60, including veteran professionals from the aerospace sector.\n“For too long, aerospace markets have lacked a 21st century solution that utilizes cutting edge technological advances such as 3D printing, digital engineering techniques, and automation. X-Bow is well-positioned to fill the gap with disruptive technology that can shake up the emerging space economy,” said Matt Bigge, Partner at Crosslink Capital, a key investor in X-Bow. “We are confident in the experienced team at X-Bow and thrilled to be supporting its mission. This company is poised to revolutionize the future of solid rocket motors.”\nThe 3D printing of rocket engine components is a venture we’ve seen before, with X-Bow being the latest challenger on the scene. Earlier this year, Chinese start-up SpaceTai announced that its 3D printing technology was capable of slashing rocket production costs by as much as 80%. Although a relatively new arrival in the aerospace sphere, SpaceTai says it can manufacture almost all of its rocket parts using its self-developed 3D printers in order to cut costs.\nElsewhere, private US aerospace firm Launcher recently hit another milestone in the testing of its 3D printed E-2 rocket engine at NASA’s Stennis Space Center. The company successfully completed a thrust chamber assembly hot fire test, following a string of testing achievements for its E-2 rocket engine at Stennis throughout 2021. The E-2 engine is designed to produce 22,000 pounds of thrust at sea level using RP-1, a highly refined form of kerosene, and liquid oxygen as its propellants.\n",

If all goes as planned the service could field the new weapon prototype, paired with Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk missiles, to soldiers by late September 2023, according to the company and service.\nThe army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) tasked Lockheed Martin with building this mid-range prototype in late 2020, at present called the ‘Typhon', which includes launchers, missiles, and a battery operations centre.\nThe idea was to create a capability to strike targets somewhere between the 500 and 1,800 km range, or greater than the future Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) but shorter than a Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) system. To do this, army programme officials joined forces with the navy to leverage existing capabilities such as the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (Mk 41 VLS), and the Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles.\n“We don't have to be the bastion of every good idea; We can actually get good ideas from other people, and we can leverage those good ideas,” RCCTO Director Lieutenant General Neil Thurgood told an audience on 10 August during the Space and Missile Defense Symposium.\nJoe DePietro, Lockheed Martin's vice-president of naval combat and missile defence systems, told Janes during a 9 August interview that this effort is more of an “engineering and integration” initiative than a major development one.\nFor the army, this meant creating a containerised version of Mk 41 VLS that can be integrated and fired from the bed of a M983A4 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT).\n“We took proven things … how we raise a panel on a flatbed to be a radar,” DePietro said. “We were able to leverage existing things that we're doing across a multitude of platforms from a radar on a truck to the Mk 41 VLS.”\n“In the case of this configuration, it is mobile [and] transportable via air,” he added.\nOnce the MRC battery is flown to a location, it is then “hooked up” to a HEMTT and soldiers are able to fire a missile in an “extremely short time period, less time than it takes to spin up the missile”, DePietro said.\n“It has a full automation suite using our machinery, control, and automation, that we use across the surface navy that was adapted to be able to do all the automation and control of the [MRC] launcher,” DePietro said. “It's very simple that someone who is not with the launcher can actually control and put it into position.”\nMore specifically, each MRC battery includes four HEMTTs each with a launcher container, a separate HEMTT used as the battery operation centre, one support vehicle for the battery operation centre, a reload trailer, and a vehicle carrying additional missiles, according to a slide Lt Gen Thurgood presented.\nFor HEMTT vehicles outfitted with launchers, when not in use, the canister is secured in a horizontal position to the back of the HEMTT bed. When soldiers decide to use the weapon system, the radar panel moves into a vertical position between the HEMTT cab and the launcher unit. This launcher unit is also now in a vertical position with four cells, each one able to hold one missile, pointing towards the sky, according to DePietro and Lt Gen Thurgood's presentation slides.\nAnother HEMTT vehicle is also used to house the battery operation centre and it includes the AEGIS Weapon System, elements of the Tomahawk Weapon System, and the army's Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS); and each one can operate up to 16 launchers, DePietro said.\nComment\nArmy soldiers are training on how to operate the MRC weapon system. Although the service has not yet received an MRC battery, Lt Gen Thurgood said the service has sent soldiers to the navy's schoolhouses to learn how to operate the AEGIS and Tomahawk.\n",

It anticipated that cumulative support for new nuclear would reach EUR5 billion by 2030, while not assuming the power plants would be online by that time.\nThe Rolls-Royce SMR is a 470 MWe design based on a small pressurised water reactor. It will provide consistent baseload generation for at least 60 years. 90% of the SMR - about 16 metres by 4 metres - will be built in factory conditions, limiting on-site activity primarily to assembly of pre-fabricated, pre-tested, modules which significantly reduces project risk and has the potential to drastically shorten build schedules.\nThe design was accepted for Generic Design Assessment (GDA) review in March this year with the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy asking the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation along with the environment regulators for England and Wales to begin the process.\nRolls-Royce SMR Chairman Paul Stein told the Reuters news agency in April that he hopes to get regulatory approval for the design by mid-2024, with the first unit producing power by 2029.\nA Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium - which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O'Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI - aims to build up to ten by 2035.\nRolls-Royce SMR said it will support international efforts to decarbonise energy systems, with a forecast to target GBP250 billion (USD295 billion) of exports. Memorandums of Understanding are already in place with Estonia, Turkey and the Czech Republic.\n",

        "原文": "Two-dimensional materials are essential for developing new ultra-compact electronic devices, but producing defect-free 2D materials is a challenge. However, discovery of new types of defects in these 2D materials may give insight into how to create materials without such imperfections, according to a group of Penn State researchers.\n\"2D materials are exciting new materials for electronics, and because they are so thin, they make it possible to shrink devices to very small sizes,\" said Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, Penn State assistant research professor of materials science and engineering. \"This is critical for making electronics more powerful so that they can handle more data. However, it is a huge challenge to grow perfect 2D materials over areas large enough to be able to make large arrays of high-quality devices.\"\nReifsnyder Hickey and the team of Penn State researchers have discovered new types of defects that provide clues for a way to create defect-free 2D materials. The study recently appeared in Nano Letters.\n\"We found new defects that are on the Angstrom scale, at one-tenth of a nanometer, and we were able to correlate the atomic structure to very large scales, at several microns,\" said Nasim Alem, Penn State associate professor of materials science and engineering and the study's corresponding author.\nThe team studied defects in monolayer films of tungsten disulfide grown by the research group of Joan Redwing, professor of materials science and engineering, Penn State. Tungsten disulfide belongs to a class of 2D crystals known as transition metal dichalcogenides, which are three-atom-thick crystals that have properties that make them ideal for the development of future electronics.\n\"2D material monolayers have different properties than bulk crystals,\" Reifsnyder Hickey said. \"For example, they have direct band gaps and can therefore be used as very small transistor materials, and their crystal symmetry enables new types of devices based on increased degrees of freedom relative to their bulk counterparts.\"\nA direct band gap is an ideal feature for exciting an electron into a conducting energy state to allow the flow of electricity. Semiconductor technology, for example, is reliant on the manipulation of electronic charge in this way. Recently, spin and valley degrees of freedom have also shown promise in 2D materials and can be manipulated to enable new types of devices. For instance, orienting multiple spins in a material can lead to magnetism, and distributing electrons among different local minimum and maximum energy states—valleys—that possess the same energy but occur with different momentum values can enable new ways to process and store information. A key to unlocking the potential of these properties is growing defect-free films, which can be achieved only by identifying and understanding atomic defects, as was achieved in this work.\nThe defects the team discovered are known as translational grain boundaries, which occur at the interface between two crystallites that have the same orientation but a translational offset. Typically, grain boundaries connect grains with dissimilar orientations and can affect the materials properties such as thermal and electrical conductivity, lessening their value for electronics. To investigate the unusual translational grain boundaries, the team used a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and a ReaxFF reactive force field simulation. ReaxFF was developed by Adri van Duin, a Penn State distinguished professor of mechanical engineering who also participated in the study.\nThe research found that the translational grain boundaries identified exist as subtle but widespread imperfections in the monolayer films.\n\"Through a synergistic approach, we were able to explain our experimental findings using simulations and uncover the growth mechanism that leads to such microstructure,\" Alem said. \"This is an important step, because by learning the underlying physics of growth and defect formation, we can learn to modify and control them, and this will have a profound effect of the electronic properties of the crystal.\"\nImproving the material would lead to better electronics, according to Reifsnyder Hickey.\n\"This investigation experimentally discovered the structures and used theory and simulation to correlate their formation with the growth conditions,\" Reifsnyder Hickey said. \"Now, we would like to implement what we have learned, so that these offsets in grains can be eliminated to form truly single-crystalline films large enough for excellent electronics. We would also like to explore the properties of these and related atomic defects.\"\nBeing able to produce improved electronics based on tungsten disulfide monolayer films with minimal defects is good news for an increasingly visual society, according to Reifsnyder Hickey.\n\"A couple decades ago, it was unheard of to watch a video on a telephone,\" Reifsnyder Hickey said. \"But now, we consume a lot of information visually, especially with videos, including news, communication and entertainment. Because electronics have become so powerful, we are able to easily carry in our pockets the devices that enable this. Our findings could lead to a new generation of such devices.\"\nOther Penn State researchers involved in the study include Nadire Nayir, Mikhail Chubarov, Tanushree H. Choudhury, Saiphaneendra Bachu, Leixin Miao, Yuanxi Wang, Chenhao Qian and Vincent H. Crespi.\n",

        "原文": "2023-02-04\nFORT WORTH—Bell aims to start test flights of its Bell 360 Invictus demonstrator for the U.S. Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) contest in the second half of this year pending delivery of the helicopter’s General Electric T901 turboshaft in March-April. \nBell’s tandem-cockpit, single-main-rotor Invictus is competing for the FARA contest against Sikorsky’s Raider X—a compound-coaxial helicopter with a pusher propeller. Both are designed to be powered by a single T901, although the Bell 360 also incorporates a supplemental power unit based on the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW207D1 turboshaft.\nBell is meanwhile completing functional tests on the 360 demonstrator at its Flight Research Center in Arlington, Texas, where the vehicle was recently reassembled following its transfer from the company’s production facility in Amarillo. Aside from the T901, the vehicle is now 95% complete and will undergo ground tests through the first half of the year, says Jayme Gonzalez, program manager for the Bell 360. \n“We should see that (T901) in the spring,” says Keith Flail, Bell’s executive vice president of Future Vertical Lift. “I’m not going to pin it down to a more specific date than that, but that’s obviously a critical piece for us so that Jayme [Gonzalez] can get the engine installed.”\nThe 3,000 shp-rated GE T901 was chosen by the Army in the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) powerplant contest for FARA in February 2019, but development was slowed initially by a protest from the losing Honeywell/Pratt & Whitney team. Further delays were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and knock-on supply chain impacts. Under the revised schedule, engine tests were due to begin in the third quarter of 2021 but finally got underway in March 2022.\nAlthough the Army was hopeful that engines could be delivered to Bell and Sikorsky in November 2022, continuing supply chain issues are thought to have slowed qualification testing for a preliminary flight rating (PFR), which is required before flight tests can start. The T901 is due to complete 1,500 hr. of ground testing before receiving a PFR. Full qualification will be completed after an overall 5,000 hr. of planned engine run time. \n“We’ll start out with restrained ground runs here,” Flail says. “We believe that’s critically important. When you start turning rotors and burning gas and showing that the product is real, that’s very significant. So, we’ll go from restrained to unrestrained ground runs onto first flight, ideally here in 2023.\n“At the same time in 2023, we’re going to be getting the draft request for proposal for the program of record. So, we’re gearing up for that, looking at what’s going to come from the government for everything that we need to propose for the weapon system,” Flail adds. For this phase, Bell is developing a full-up weapon system version of the Invictus dubbed Increment One.\nThe Increment One aircraft will look very similar “in terms of scale and size” to the competitive prototype, Flail says. Incorporating lessons learned from the design and build of the demonstrator, increment one development work will include the design and verification of a modular open system architecture (MOSA) with Sierra Nevada, with which Bell recently teamed for FARA. \n“We are putting that lab together as a proving ground for MOSA. In 2023, there’s a big event with the Army. Essentially, they bring in a third party. We say we’re MOSA compliant and someone else will come in and see if that’s truly the case. Can you do the things that you need to bring in new capabilities and address obsolescence for vendor lock, and do it affordably? So, we think we’re on the cusp of a great opportunity there,” Flail says.\nIn contrast to the high intensity of the FARA program, Bell’s work on the V-280 Valor tiltrotor has come to a halt since its December victory in the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program was challenged by the losing Sikorsky-Boeing team. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has until April 7 to rule on the protest. Until then, Bell has temporarily reassigned V-280 design and engineering staff to other programs ranging from V-22 and H-1 contracting to the High-Speed VTOL.\n“We’re making sure that we’re respecting the process as that all continues,” Flail said. “It’s an official ‘stop work,’ so we can’t work on anything related to the weapons contract. We’re keeping all the folks here and ready to go, because we don’t know exactly when the protest ruling will happen. We’ve got to be spring-loaded and be ready to move back out again,” he adds.\nCommenting briefly on the FLRAA, Bell President and CEO Mitch Snyder says “we are patiently waiting and looking forward to getting started on the program.”\n",

        "原文": "The Navy will pilot a program to harness artificial intelligence and machine learning on the service's \"biggest lever\" -- the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, Capt. Scott Larson, program manager of surface ship readiness and sustainment, said Wednesday.\nUsing predictive analytics and algorithms, the Navy could reduce unplanned maintenance and return precious man-hours to the ship, Larson said at the Surface Navy Association’s National Symposium.\nDestroyers are the Navy’s biggest population of ships, Larson said, so if the service can harness AI and ML on them, it will be easier to sell that potential across other platforms.\n“When we get to that architecture, getting to that best-of-breed analytics . . . I think that's what really allows us to scale and proliferate the capability not just to DDG-51, but to other surface ship platforms so that the whole fleet can capitalize on the benefit,” Larson said. \nThe first phase of the pilot will go live on a DDG-51 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 in Norfolk, VA, Larson said.\n“With phase one, what we really want to do is validate the link between the conditions-based trigger on the equipment sets that we’re going to be analyzing, and then validate that link between the conditions-based trigger and the calendar-based trigger,” Larson said. \nWhen onboard algorithms detect an anomaly or a signal from a piece of equipment that something’s not right, it will trigger a preventive maintenance action via SKED, Larson said, which is the planned scheduling software the surface force uses to manage and execute shipboard maintenance.\nLast fall, the Navy announced it is building Task Force Hopper to speed up this process and apply AI and ML across the surface warfare enterprise. \nLt. j.g. Artem Sherbinin, a founding member of the Hopper group, said while the service still faces challenges in implementing artificial intelligence, there is recognition across the Defense Department that this is important, and the FY-22 National Defense Authorization Act mandates that by fiscal year 2025, every service must get this right. \n“Whoever controls the most data will get to AI first. To quote, unfortunately, Vladimir Putin, whoever gets the AI first will control the world, as the most influential technology in the history of mankind,” Sherbinin said at an AI panel Thursday at the symposium. \nIn a surface warfare document released this week, “Surface Warfare: The Competitive Edge,” Vice Adm. Roy Kitchener, commander of Naval Surface Forces, asks for Task Force Hopper’s artificial intelligence initiatives “with a 10-year horizon,” including a digital infrastructure roadmap, no later than June 1.\nNot only does AI and ML have the capability to reduce maintenance, Kitchener said it can improve readiness.\nSince AI is predictive in nature, it uses modeling to help the Navy decide which ships should be deployed and when, Kitchener told reporters last week. \n“They can look at that data and say, ‘Hey, here's your best candidates to deploy early or to get ready to deploy earlier to sustain,’” Kitchener said. \nModeling with AI can also develop concepts of operations for specific missions in the western Pacific, Kitchener added. \n“I really see this as a very ripe area,” he said. “I would argue, the surface force has the most versatility and utilization of AI, we just have so many different things we can put it into.”\nWhen asked about Task Force Hopper’s tie to the budget, Kitchener said the Navy is still considering funding as it identifies the areas where the service should invest. \n“We're talking to academia, industry . . . give us some areas that you think we should do, here's what we're interested in,” Kitchener said. “And then once we define those, then we'll go after the resource and so I think a little bit more homework for us on that.”\n",

        "原文": "Researchers atCornell Universityhave come up with a novel biomaterial that can be used to create artificial skin capable of mimicking the behavior of natural human tissues.\nThanks to its unique composition, made up of collagen mixed with a ‘zwitterionic’ hydrogel, the team’s biohybrid composite is said to be soft and biocompatible, but flexible enough to withstand continued distortion. While the scientists’ R&D project remains ongoing, they say their bio-ink could one day be used as a basis for 3D printing scaffolds from patients’ cells, which effectively heal wounds in-situ.\n“Ultimately, we want to create something for regenerative medicine purposes, such as a piece of scaffold that can withstand some initial loads until the tissue fully regenerates,” said Nikolaos Bouklas, one of the study’s co-lead authors. “With this material, you could 3D print a porous scaffold with cells that could eventually create the actual tissue around the scaffold.”\nCombining the natural and synthetic\nGiven the constantly-moving nature of the human body, our tissues need to be both soft enough to bend on command, while also being sufficiently robust to withstand constant loading. When these cells become worn out or damaged, the Cornell team says hydrogels and synthetic materials could serve as replacements, but neither has the right mix of biological and mechanical qualities to do so.\nIn particular, the scientists suggest that synthetic plastics often lack the ability to support and maintain live cells, alongside the microstructural organization which makes them functional. When it comes to natural polymers such as collagen, fibrin or hyaluronic acid, meanwhile, the researchers maintain that they’re able to replicate the biocompatibility of living tissues, but they tend to be more fragile.\nIn order to make a bio-ink with the flexibility and cell-friendliness needed to enable the production of lifelike artificial skin, the team has therefore turned to ‘zwitterionic hydrogel.’ Specifically, the scientists have found that mixing collagen with the material, which contains both positively and negatively-charged molecular groups, could allow it to withstand multiple impacts while supporting cellular growth.\n“These charge groups interact with the negatively and positively charged groups in the collagen,” explains one of the study’s other co-lead authors, Lawrence Bonassar. “This interaction is what enables the materials to dissipate energy and achieve high levels of toughness.”\nA basis for more lifelike artificial skin?\nInterestingly, in their paper, the researchers say the formulation of their biohybrid composite required only “simple mixing,” as their collagen self-assembled into a fibrillar network, which in turn, became ionically linked to its surrounding hydrogel. According to Bouklas, this yielded “the same interconnected network of collagen seen in natural cartilage, which otherwise would be extremely hard to produce.”\nOnce they’d created their material, the team subjected it to lab testing, which showed that compared to an untreated zwitterionic matrix, the addition of collagen had increased its elastic modulus by 40%. Integrating collagen with the hydrogel was also found to enable the material to absorb eleven times more energy before cracking, while giving it properties akin to those of tissues like articular cartilage.\nElsewhere, on the biocompatibility front, the scientists found their collagen-loaded polymer to be over 100 times more capable of supporting cellular growth, and it demonstrated a cell viability of more than 90%. Moving forwards, the researchers say they intend to continue working on the biosynthesis process behind their material, and they’ve now begun to test its viability for the 3D printing of tissues.\n",

Teal’s Golden Eagle drone with Autonodyne software has already successfully demonstrated drone “swarms” and provides features like “unlimited surveillance” that seamlessly rotates multiple drones over a single point of interest for 24/7 coverage.\nUnder the terms of the license, Teal has secured exclusive right to Autonodyne’s software suite for “autonomy and exchange of control among humans and machines to perform tasks involving crewed and/or uncrewed vehicles.” Autonodyne has agreed to exclusively provide its software to Teal’s current and prospective customers for single vehicles, multi-vehicles, and linked multi-vehicles, whether existing or planned in the future, and includes Autonodyne’s patents and unpatented technology. \nRed Cat CEO Jeff Thompson said, “Teal’s products have repeatedly proven in testing that they can handle difficult mission-specific assignments with ease and offer autonomous capabilities that are superior to other drones. Autonodyne is the first of multiple development partners we plan to integrate and test with for prospective applications in the government and military segments served by our Teal division. Under the terms of the agreement, Autonodyne software will only be made available to Teal, effectively jumping Teal ahead of other drone companies seeking to provide multi-vehicle control or capabilities like unlimited surveillance. Competitors will have to develop their own software or secure licenses from others with inferior test performance.\n“Adding Autonodyne software to the Golden Eagle is as significant to our Company’s financial success as it is to our customers’ mission success. At 42%, the gross margin on the Golden Eagle is certainly good, but adding Autonodyne software to the Golden Eagle increases our gross margin to over 60%,” concluded Thompson.\nGeorge Matus, founder of Teal, said, “Red Cat has immediate potential to be a leader in this industry’s government and military segments. Golden Eagle was selected as one of only a handful of drones certified for U.S. Government procurement and it is continuously being improved, with a new version to be announced soon. Our hardware-enabled software approach allows us to meet or exceed the security and performance requirements for military operation, border control, public safety, and more.

        "原文": "The manufacturers commit to helping smaller U.S. based suppliers increase their application of additive manufacturing.\nIt has been announced that Boeing and Northrop Grumman have joined the Additive Manufacturing Forward (AM Forward) initiative, committing to helping smaller U.S.-based suppliers increase their use of AM.\nAM Forward was launched by President Biden on May 6 this year. It is a voluntary compact among large manufacturers and is organised and supported by the Applied Science and Technology Research Organisation of America (ASTRO America), a non-profit organisation. With the additions of Boeing and Northrop Grumman, AM Forward now totals seven US manufacturers, including GE Aviation, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies and Siemens Energy.\nThe AM Forward initiative aims to help more American companies adopt 3D printing or other high-performance manufacturing technologies. The initiative states that although U.S. manufacturing is making a comeback, not enough American companies are adopting AM.\n“A priority of this administration is to lower the cost of the goods and services that families rely on, and one of the best ways to do that is to make more things in America, with more secure and more resilient supply chains,” said Sue Helper, Senior Advisor for Industrial Strategy, White House Office of Management and Budget.\nHelper continued: “AM Forward focuses on additive manufacturing to help us achieve these goals. We applaud Boeing and Northrop Grumman for recognising the benefits of promoting additive manufacturing in their supply chains and for making public commitments to support broader adoption.”\nBy joining AM Forward, the companies make clear commitments to purchase additively produced parts from smaller U.S.-based suppliers; train the workers of their suppliers on new additive technologies; provide detailed technical assistance to support their suppliers’ adoption of new capabilities; and engage in the development of commons standards and certification for additive products.\n“The supply chain crisis isn’t just about improving our ports. It’s also about innovating shop floors, right here in America’s small business factories,” said Neal Orringer, President of ASTRO America.\nOther public commitments for Boeing, as part of AM Forward, include it targeting an increase of Boeing qualified small and medium-sized supplier capacity by 30% and providing technical guidance.\nThe technical guidance will help meet Boeing and industry qualification requirements including delta qualifications, it will also target small and medium-sized suppliers to complete on request for quote (RFQ) packages sent out for products utilising additive manufacturing technologies.\nNorthrop Grumman will commit to targeting 50% of RFQ packages sent out for products, machinery, manufacturing tooling, and/or manufacturing process development utilising additive or related technologies to be completed by US-based SMM suppliers. It will also target the external sourcing of AM processes and parts from an SMM supplier.\n“We know the competitiveness of the U.S. industrial base, including Boeing, relies on the capability of a wide spectrum of suppliers producing and post-processing critical aerospace parts,” said Dr. Melissa Orme, Vice President of Boeing Additive Manufacturing. “Through AM Forward, we are confident we can collaboratively accelerate AM adoption at scale; increase the agility, capacity, and resiliency of U.S. supply chains; and support and expand good-paying jobs across the U.S.”\nSpeaking about how important AM is to U.S global competitiveness, Matt Bromberg, Corporate Vice President, Global Operations, Northrop Grumman, said: “We know that the competitiveness of the U.S. defense industrial base relies on the capability of thousands of small to medium size manufacturers (SMM) producing and post-processing critical aerospace parts.”\nAM Forward helps government and industry to work together to adopt additive manufacturing at scale. The project aims to increase the agility, capacity and resiliency of U.S. supply chains, alongside supporting and sustaining jobs across the United States.\n",

CQ Brown told officials at the Dubai International Air Chiefs Conference on Nov. 13. \"What if we did not have to produce sorties to achieve the same effect?\"\nBy VALERIE INSINNAon November 16, 2021 at 9:01 AM\nDUBAI: International air forces could learn a lesson from Netflix about how to use technology to decimate an enemy, the US Air Force’s top general told an audience of international air chiefs on Saturday.\nAfter running Blockbuster out of business by offering DVD rentals delivered to customers’ doorstep, Netflix revolutionized media consumption by creating the first widespread movie streaming service, effectively turning a hardware product into a software product, saidAir Force chief of staff Gen. CQ Brown.\nA similar revolution could be coming in warfare, as advances in artificial intelligence, supercomputing, cyber weapons and space point to an ever-increased reliance on data and software, as well as a trend toward non-kinetic effects, he said.\n“I can’t predict the future, but I would bet the non-kinetic effects will reign supreme,” Brown said during theDubai International Air Chiefs Conference. “Now we’re somewhere stuck in the thinking that mass needs to be physical. What if we did not have to produce sorties to achieve the same effect? What if a future small diameter bomb looks like ones and zeros?”\nFULL COVERAGE:Dubai Air Show 2021\nIn a world where data is king, the Air Force is still stovepiped, with many of its platforms unable to connect to each other.\nThe service is currently developing theAdvanced Battle Management Systemin the hopes of linking its sensors and shooters, as well as to integrate emerging technologies like machine learning that can speed up decision making, Brown said.\nRELATED:Digital design revolution key to All Domain ops, Air and Space officials say\nBut to realize the full potential of how data can be synthesized and processed, the US military must be able to connect with allies and partner nations, and becoming more interoperable is a requirement, Brown said. Right now, that’s too difficult, with too much bureaucratic red tape.\n“For those of us here today, thinking differently begins by knocking down archaic policies that prevent us from sharing data, which our warfighters depend upon,” Brown said.\nThe elephant in the room\nInteroperability and all domain command and control were the main themes of the conference, but hanging over the event was the albatross of the stalled F-35 sale to Dubai, which remains unfinished largely due to US concerns that Abu Dhabi’s use of the Chinese 5G provider Huaweicould leave the high-tech F-35 vulnerable to exploitation.\nNone of the officials — including Brown and Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force — mentioned or even obliquely referenced the ongoing negotiations. Instead, the two officials made similar points about how military partners must overcome technical and security challenges to be able to share data.\n“Security challenges will be present in any shared multi-domain operation environment,” Al Alawi said. “Because of the core of the shared information construct, a certain level of trust has to exist.”\nAl Alawi said partner nations need a mutually agreed upon “zero trust” security model to ensure data can move safely across different networks, as well as robust protections against electronic warfare and cyber attacks.\nOn the US side, Brown agreed that “data security is important and something we must get right.”\nHe also noted that overclassification is a continued problem, as is the Pentagon’s reluctance to adopt foreign technology platforms, even those developed by trusted partners. Additionally, the United States also needs to design its products to be exportable from the outset, rather than modifying them later on, he said.\nRELATED:Cyber concerns, classification woes lead Space Survey results\nThe Pentagon is moving in the right direction with initiatives like the Defense Exportability Initiative Program, which aims to build in technology security features for programs in early development, making them easier to sell to foreign militaries later on, Brown said.\nA total of 18 programs have undertaken Defense Exportability Initiative Program feasibility studies or design activities, and the hope is to “save money, improve systems and security and reduce development time and increase interoperability with our allies and partners,” Brown said.\nHowever, Brown did not expand upon how ABMS — or any of its major future acquisition programs — would be engineered to plug into partner nation’s systems and share data, leaving it unclear exactly how the US Air Force will ensure its multidomain command and control system is able to harness data from allies.\n",

        "原文": "\"While improving the physical infrastructure of these facilities will be critical to success, it’s equally essential that we take this opportunity to build the digital infrastructure required to accelerate our readiness advantage,\" writes Ret. Adm. James Foggo.\nThe US Navy’s race to modernize its fleet has put a strain on its public shipyards. In the op-ed below, Retired Adm. James Foggo says it’s high time his former service started emphasizing digitization from the outset so it can work smarter, not harder.\nFor the foreseeable future, the United States will not build more ships per year than China.\nThat’s the reality we face as we enter a new maritime era. Our adversaries are devoting enormous resources to close the capability gap, and in order to maintain superiority, we must both build as fast as we can, and maximize the maritime power of our existing fleet.\nThis will require us to lead in both traditional warfighting and being more creative in developing new techniques. Mastering both of these will ensure readiness today and, in the future, readiness that will hopefully continue to deter large-scale conflict.\nA major element of maximizing the power of our current fleet starts within our Navy’s shipyards. The Navy’s four public shipyards — Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility — are essential elements of our national defense. These shipyards perform vital maintenance activities on submarines, surface combatants and, aircraft carriers — from overhauls to nuclear refuelings to refits. They are the foundation of ensuring our submarine and carrier fleet is modern, operational, and most importantly available.\nBut today our shipyards face a major challenge: they were built a long time ago, some dating back to the 1800s, and modernizing these facilities has taken a backseat to other priorities over the years. An August 2020 GAO report [PDF] found that maintenance delays on aircraft carrier and submarine repairs from 2015 through 2019 resulted in a total of 7,424 days that those vessels weren’t available for operations—the equivalent of losing half an aircraft carrier and three submarines each year. Just last month Rear Admiral Bill Greene confirmed that the Navy has 41 surface ships currently in a major maintenance period, with 100 more in planning, and is expecting a 36 percent on-time delivery rate in fiscal 2022, down from 44 percent in FY21.\nThese delays translate to significant reduction in deployed combat power. To close this gap, the Navy developed the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan (SIOP) in 2018 to reconfigure, modernize and optimize our four aging Naval Shipyards.\nAnd while improving the physical infrastructure of these facilities will be critical to success, it’s equally essential that we take this opportunity to build the digital infrastructure required to accelerate our readiness advantage.\nDigital Accelerants Across the Maintenance Lifecycle\nUnderstanding the digital opportunity starts with understanding the maintenance lifecycle. When a vessel arrives at a shipyard it has needs: manpower, parts, services, repairs, modernizations, alterations and restorations. These activities require specific and often exotic materials, implemented as part of a defined process, driven and overseen by uniquely skilled operators.\nThis is an incredibly complex task. Every station within a shipyard tackles a different component of the project. It’s a multi-step process executed by several different teams. The work planned at any given step is dependent on actions completed in previous steps, as well as the availability of required services and parts. Any misalignment across people, material and process will result in delays. The three major challenges to efficiency include:\nInefficient workflows: Sometimes the right person is not available or doesn’t have the right materials at the right time.\nTalent & training gaps: There’s a dearth of skilled maintainers needed to perform these incredibly unique tasks.\nOceans of data: Maintenance solutions are hidden in vast quantities of historical repair information that is unstructured and time-consuming to locate and use.\nThe Navy is tackling these challenges across three SIOP lines of effort (LOEs): Drydocks, Infrastructure and Industrial Plant Equipment. And digital technologies are foundational to driving new levels of speed and efficiency across the maintenance lifecycle. Analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning tools can be deployed to uncover critical insights, make data-driven predictions in real-time, and seamlessly share critical information across shipyard teams. These digital solutions serve as a force-multiplier, maximizing operator talent and empowering faster, smarter decisions for everything from keeping tabs on physical machinery performance to workflow efficiency.\nNaval shipyards share many attributes with manufacturing facilities in the private sector, and companies have been deploying these technologies for years with dramatic results. A recent McKinsey study on the manufacturing industry found that leveraging digital technology across inventory management, labor productivity, machine downtime reduction, throughput increase, and forecasting accuracy drove 15 to 50 percent value gains in cost reduction and efficiency. That’s a significant gain and gives a sense of what can be achieved by employing digital technologies to improve traditional methods.\nPut The Operator At The Center Of Optimization Efforts\nDigital transformation will require an upfront investment, but the proven return on that investment (ROI) in terms of readiness gains make it essential if we’re going to be competitive. Beyond cost, perhaps the biggest barrier is trust. Operators and leaders have to trust that the technology will help drive mission outcomes. So, here are four recommendations for overcoming these barriers and seamlessly integrating digital within the broader SIOP strategy:\nDedicate 3 percent of SIOP budget to digital. A budget commitment at this level would not only be enough to achieve significant transformation goals but the ROI across efficiency and vessel availability would be game-changing.\nStart with operator challenges and work back. Involve the maintainers from the outset. Talk to them about their pain points, deliver the training required to close skill gaps and focus on commercially available technology that can be customized for their unique needs.\nProve the value using existing and simulated datasets. At its core, this is a new relationship between the operator and the AI. The quickest way to establish trust is to showcase the power of the technology on an existing dataset that the operator uses every day. If one isn’t available, use simulated datasets to demonstrate what’s possible.\nDo no harm. Ships and shipyards are complex environments with some of the most demanding physical, electromagnetic, and information security requirements in the world. Digital optimization must not be disruptive. Avoid ‘rip and replace’ of major data systems and focus on problem-oriented solutions that can be seamlessly integrated.\nWe must invest in a modern digital foundation for shipyard optimization that maximizes the operational value of our physical assets while empowering personnel to be as efficient, accurate and productive as possible. The stakes are too high to do anything less.\nShipyard optimization is an urgent national security need, but it also represents a once in a lifetime opportunity to truly modernize. Our adversaries are embracing sophisticated digital technologies across every aspect of defense operations, and maintaining our advantage requires technical superiority in every facet of readiness. We need modern shipyards.\n",

        "原文": "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Subterranean Challenge, an effort to develop robot technologies capable of performing underground, is expected to host its final contest next month, but the program has advanced robotics technology that already are being used.\nThe program aims to develop technologies to rapidly map, navigate and search complex underground environments such as human-made tunnel systems, urban undergrounds and natural cave networks. The challenge run by the agency commonly known as DARPA might be described as two challenges in one since it focuses both on physical and virtual robot technologies.\nThe best performing team in the Systems Competition will be awarded a $2 million prize while the best performing team in the Virtual Competition will be awarded a $750,000 prize. After three years of development, DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge teams will get the chance to compete in the Final Event being held at the Louisville Mega Cavern in Louisville, Kentucky, on September 21-23.\nThe physical robotic systems can take any form or be any size. They can walk, swim, fly or roll. Ideally, the program will result in systems capable of performing in any underground environment, including manmade tunnels, such as mines, subway stations, parking garages and sewer systems, as well as natural cave networks. “What DARPA has done is create, in a number of cases, an environment that is audaciously difficult but really raises the bar on the challenges these robots will face in four areas, namely autonomy, networking, perception and mobility,” explains Timothy Chung, DARPA’s Subterranean Challenge program manager. “The idea here is to get robots that are not just the best swimmer or runner but in fact, the best all-around triathlete.”\nIt often can take years for technologies grown in government labs to be used in the real world, and sometimes they never are. But Chung does not foresee that being an issue for some of the components and integrated systems developed under the program. “We’ve already had a number of startup company spin-outs from some of these competition teams, and I think that’s a pathway to commercialize and productize and really see these technologies make it in the real world,” he says. “There are a number of technologies that are of keen interest to security and safety personnel as well.”\nSome of the technologies could have immediate impact upon completion of the program, he suggests. “Across the board, I’m excited that the vision of a DARPA Grand Challenge, which tries to have these impacts maybe a decade or more later, will be able to find impact occurring even upon immediate completion of the final event.”\nIn fact, some already have been useful in the real world. “Some of them have already been deployed to mine shafts and infrastructure and oil rigs for maintenance and management, so they’re getting the real-world experience on the commercial side,” Chung reports.\nThe program has seen advances in multiple technology areas, including two of the most challenging: underground communications and geolocation without the availability of GPS signals.\n“We require these teams to report out an absolute position rather than just a relative position from where they started. If you’re trying to drill down to send in food and water and air to trapped minors, if you’re off even a handful of meters, you’ve missed the mark,” Chung declares. “You’re drilling from an absolute geocoordinate from the surface trying to get to an absolute geocoordinate underground. That just needs to be there.”\nThe teams involved in the contest found a number of solutions. “The types of technologies our teams have developed have really advanced how well one can do not just with a camera or an infrared sensor or a thermal camera or LIDAR or radar or even acoustics. They really identified ways to zero in on that tough nugget of geolocalizing themselves and or things that they find in the underground space,” Chung says. “I think that will translate really well to other application areas, whether that be infrastructure inspection or construction site management or exploration and discovery for scientific missions. That has been one of the really cool advances that has near-term impact.”\n",

        "原文": "WASHINGTON: Capella Space will become the first synthetic aperture radar firm to demonstration optical link connectivity with the Space Development Agency’s Transport Layer of data relay satellites, the California startup announced today.\n“Our team at Capella Space is thrilled to become the first commercial SAR company to demonstrate compatibility with the SDA’s National Defense Space Architecture and standards,” said Christian Lenz, CTO at Capella Space in a press release. “Enabling our satellites to integrate with the new SDA architecture efficiently is a critical step for us to work seamlessly with the U.S. defense and intelligence sector.”\nOptical intersatellite links, or OISLs, use lasers to communicate and zip data between satellites on orbit — a technology that is both the central node and the biggest challenge in SDA’s effort to build a multi-layered National Defense Space Architecture in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to provide both new capabilities and resiliency to DoD’s current space systems.\nSDA’s architecture in turn is at the heart of DoD’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiative to link all US military sensors with all shooters in near-real time in future globalized conflict with peer competitors across all domains — air, land, sea, space and cyberspace. At the same time, JADC2 also is crucial for the Space Force as it figures out how to “fight” in space and protect US satellites.\nIn the first Breaking Defense Space Survey, 69 percent of respondents reported that JADC2 is either “very” or “extremely” important to space warfare.\nOISLs further are the focus of two other SDA experiments:\nMandrake II: Two satellites, developed by DARPA and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), to demo optical cross links between satellites. The birds were built by Astro Digital and carry an OSIL developed by SA Photonics, and are part of DARPA’s Blackjack program aimed at demonstrating the military utility of small, cheap satellites.\nLaser Interconnect and Networking Communication System (LINCS): Two OSIL demo sats being developed by General Atomics; these will be used to link to the MQ-9, not coincidently also built by GA.\n“Capella Space will install optical communications terminals (OCTs) on its commercial SAR satellites, starting in late 2022,” according to the company’s announcement. “This will enable the company to utilize highly efficient laser communications technology to send and receive data to and from its satellites in low Earth orbit, relaying data to compatibly equipped government satellites and military operations on the ground.”\nCapella is using Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 Optical Communications Terminal, which Mynaric has previously demonstrated is compatible with SDA systems and standards, the announcement added.\n“We are honored to be selected as the optical communications terminal vendor for Capella Space’s integration work with the SDA. The announcement today highlights the importance of standardization and compatibility within the industry,” said Bulent Altan, CEO of Mynaric.\nAn SDA spokesperson explained that the shared-cost agreement with Capella is separate from from its pending plans to launch 18 satellites, called Tranche 1 Demonstration and Experimentation System (T1DES), to carry experimental payloads developed by mission partners from industry and other government agencies. Under that effort, interested vendors had until yesterday to respond to the agency’s Oct. 8 draft request for proposals — with SDA planning to put out a final RFP early next year.\n",

        "原文": "Scientists in Australia have used tin mono-sulfide (SnS) nanosheets to create the thinnest X-ray detector ever made, potentially enabling real-time imaging of cellular biology.\nX-ray detectors are tools that allow energy transported by radiation to be recognized visually or electronically, like medical imaging or Geiger counters.\nSnS has already shown great promise as a material for use in photovoltaics, field effect transistors and catalysis.\nNow, members of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science, based at Monash University and RMIT University, have shown that SnS nanosheets are also excellent candidates for use as soft X-ray detectors.\nTheir research, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, indicates that SnS nanosheets possess high photon absorption coefficients, allowing them to be used in making ultrathin soft X-ray detectors with high sensitivity and a rapid response time.\nThese materials were found to be even more sensitive than another emerging candidate (metal halide perovskites), boasting a faster response time than established detectors and are tuneable for sensitivity across the soft X-ray region.\nThe SnS X-ray detectors created by the team are less than 10 nanometres thick. To put things in perspective, a sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometres thick, and your fingernails grow about one nanometre every second. Previously, the thinnest X-ray detectors created were between 20 and 50 nanometres.\nConsiderable work remains to explore the full potential of the SnS X-ray detectors, but Professor Jacek Jasieniak of Monash's Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the senior author of the paper, believes it's possible this could one day lead to real-time imaging of cellular processes.\n\"The SnS nanosheets respond very quickly, within milliseconds,\" he said.\n\"You can scan something and get an image almost instantaneously. The sensing time dictates the time resolution. In principle, given the high sensitivity and high time resolution, you could be able to see things in real time.\n\"You might be able to use this to see cells as they interact. You're not just producing a static image, you could see proteins and cells evolving and moving using X-rays.\"\nWhy are such sensitive and responsive detectors important? X-rays can be broadly divided into two types: \"Hard\" X-rays are the kind used by hospitals to scan the body for broken bones and other illnesses.\nPerhaps less well known but just as important are \"soft\" X-rays, which have a lower photon energy and can be used to study wet proteins and living cells, a crucial component of cellular biology.\nSome of these measurements take place in the \"water window,\" a region of the electromagnetic spectrum in which water is transparent to soft X-rays.\nSoft X-ray detection can be conducted using a Synchrotron, a particle accelerator like the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, but access to this type of hugely expensive infrastructure is difficult to secure.\nRecent advances in non-synchrotron soft X-ray laser sources may allow lower cost, portable detection systems to be designed, providing an accessible alternative to Synchrotrons for researchers around the world.\nBut for this approach to work, we will need soft X-ray detector materials that are highly sensitive to low energy X-rays, provide excellent spatial resolution, and are cost effective.\nSome existing soft X-ray detectors use an indirect mechanism, in which ionizing radiation is converted into visible photons. This approach allows for multiple energy ranges and frame rates to be studied, but is difficult to prepare and offers limited resolutions.\nDirect detection methods are easier to prepare and offer better resolutions, because the detector material can be thinner than indirect approaches.\nGood candidate materials need a high X-ray absorption coefficient, which is calculated using the atomic number of the absorbing atoms, X-ray incident energy, density and atomic mass of an atom.\nHigh atomic mass and low energy X-rays favor high absorption, and soft X-rays are more strongly absorbed in thin materials compared to hard X-rays.\nNanocrystal films and ferromagnetic flakes have shown promise as certain types of soft X-ray detectors, but they are not well equipped to handle the water region.\nThat's where the SnS nanosheets come in.\nOne of the lead authors, Dr. Nasir Mahmood of RMIT University, said the sensitivity and efficiency of SnS nanosheets depends greatly on their thickness and lateral dimensions, which are not possible to control through traditional fabrication methods.\nUsing a liquid metal-based exfoliation method allowed the researchers to produce high quality, large area sheets with controlled thickness, which can efficiently detect soft X-ray photons in the water region. Their sensitivity can be further enhanced by a process of stacking the ultrathin layers.\nThey represent major improvements in sensitivity and response time compared to existing direct soft X-ray detectors.\nThe researchers hope their findings will open new avenues for the development of next-generation, highly sensitive X-ray detectors based on ultrathin materials.\nFirst author Dr. Babar Shabbir of Monash's Department of Materials Science and Engineering said: \"In the long run, to commercialize this, we need to test a many-pixel device. At this stage we don't have the imaging system. But this provides us with a knowledge platform and a prototype.\"\n",

X-ray detector is a detection tool that can identify radiation transmission energy by visual or electronic means. Researchers found that tin sulfide nanosheets are excellent candidate materials for soft X-ray detectors, because tin sulfide nanosheets have high photon absorption coefficient, which makes them available for making ultra-thin soft X-ray detectors with high sensitivity and fast response. They used tin sulfide nano-sheets to manufacture a tin sulfide X-ray detector with a thickness of less than 10 nanometers. Through tests, it was found that this tin sulfide nano-sheet was even more sensitive than another emerging candidate material, metal halide perovskite, and also had faster response speed than existing detectors, which could adjust sensitivity in soft X-ray areas.

        "原文": "Safran is proceeding with its master plan in electric propulsion by simultaneously pursuing the certification of electric motors while cooperating with startup airframers. By gathering experience with prototypes and studying electric propulsion architectures at the aircraft level, Safran is positioning itself as the supplier of a full range of motors for all-electric and hybrid propulsion systems, from light aircraft to narrowbodies.\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency （EASA）is expected to certify the company’s 100-kW （135-shp）EngineUs 100 electric propulsion unit in 2023. “Then we will launch the EngineUs 500,” says Herve Blanc, manager of the power division at Toulouse-based Safran Electrical & Power.\nThe designation of Safran’s motors indicates cruise power; their maximum power is greater. The EngineUs 100 and EngineUs 500 have maximum powers of 150 kW and 750 kW, respectively.\nFor light aircraft, Safran plans to market an electric counterpart to the existing Lycoming product range in piston engines. “From the beginning, the EngineUs 100—the motor itself and its distribution and protection systems—was created as a Lycoming replacement,” Blanc says.\nThe company also envisions a family of more powerful motors that would be the equivalent of Pratt & Whitney’s PT6A turboprop series. For example, the appropriate size for a 19-seat regional aircraft is the EngineUs 500, he says.\nU.S.-based Bye Aerospace received its first EngineUs 100s early this year. The motor will power the two-seat eFlyer 2 electric trainer, which is planned to fly this year; FAA Part 23 certification is expected in 2023. Bye’s other two projects are the four-seat eFlyer 4 and the 8-12-seat eFlyer 800. “We are jointly working on their architecture,” Blanc says. “We are converging.”\nSafran, meanwhile, has accumulated flight hours with two EngineUs 45s on French startup VoltAero’s Cassio 1 testbed. The motors are part of a hybrid-electric propulsion system on the modified Cessna 337H Skymaster. “The Cassio 1 has flown in rainy and cold conditions,” he says.\nThe motors have now been removed from the aircraft and disassembled for analysis. Although no issue was encountered, the examination will provide useful feedback. Engineers can see whether parts such as bearings experience wear as predicted after 100-200 hr. of operation, Blanc adds.\nA key part of the work with VoltAero has been on control law settings. An electric motor has a much faster response than a conventional aircraft engine. That responsiveness has to be adjusted so that a pilot is not too surprised during operation, Blanc says.\nIn addition, Safran supplied motors for Bell’s electrically distributed anti-torque （EDAT）system. The EDAT testbed, which flew in 2019, was a modified Bell 429 with four fixed-pitch electric fans mounted in the vertical stabilizer, replacing the conventional tail rotor.\nAn unnamed Chinese electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing prototype uses Safran motors as well. In total, over the various platforms, Safran’s EngineUs motors have logged 1,000 flight hours, Blanc says.\nHaving both European and U.S. customers is proving useful, allowing Safran to work with both EASA and the FAA to define a certification template. “We contribute to aligning their approaches,” Blanc adds.\nEarly in April, Safran signed agreements with Toulouse-based Aura Aero, a light and regional aircraft manufacturer. Safran will supply the propulsion system for Aura’s Integral E flight demonstrator. The electric two-seater is an evolution of the Integral R, an aerobatic-capable piston single.\nSafran was to deliver a 100-kW EngineUs electric motor this summer so that the Integral E could fly by year-end. Unfortunately, the Integral R prototype crashed on April 12, killing the two pilots. As a result, Aura’s electric project will likely be delayed.\nSafran had also signed a memorandum of understanding with Aura to work jointly on the ERA 19-seater. The aircraft is targeted at regional air transport, and though it is ultimately intended to have a full-electric configuration, it will initially receive a hybrid system.\nAura and Safran will collaborate on defining both the propulsive and nonpropulsive electric system architectures. “We will work as an integrated team and study trade-offs until the end of the year,” Blanc says. “We will answer questions such as what is the right level of distribution for propulsion.”\nWith today’s batteries, at a specific energy of 200-300 Wh/kg, the ERA may incorporate a turbine engine as a range extender. This will run at a constant, optimal speed to feed the motors directly or charge batteries. “Typically, takeoff would be all-electric, and cruise would use the range extender before an all-electric landing,” Blanc says.\nAura is planning on a first flight of the ERA in 2024 and entry into service in 2027. Such an aggressive schedule is possible, according to Blanc. “Our motors, batteries and distribution systems will be ready,” he says.\nThe next generation of solid-state batteries, expected to be available between 2025 and 2030, will have a specific energy of 400-500 Wh/kg. They might enable a 19-seater to be an all-electric system or, at least, to make less use of the range extender, Blanc says. They may be suitable for upgrading the aircraft after 2027.\nSafran will integrate cells from specialist suppliers, which will be carefully chosen for aerospace use. “A battery is a complicated object,” Blanc says. “Offering a good specific energy is not enough. We want to know the power it can deliver depending on the number of cycles it has performed. A chemistry is credible when it has been tested for weeks with cycles representative of aviation.”\nIn the future, Safran and GE Aviation—its partner in the CFM International joint venture—may consider the introduction of electric motors in a hybrid turbofan. Coupled with sustainable aviation fuels, motors that boost a thermal engine might be an efficient formula to cut a narrowbody’s CO2 emissions.\n",

Safran will provide propulsion systems for Aura's Integrated E flight demonstrator. The electric two-seater aircraft is an evolution of the Integrated R, a single-engine piston aircraft capable of aerobatics.Safran will deliver a 100kW EngineUs motor in the summer of 2022 so that the Integrated E can fly before the end of the year. Unfortunately, the Integral R prototype crashed on April 12, killing two pilots. As a result, Aura's electricity project could be delayed.Safran also signed a memorandum of understanding with Aura to jointly develop the 19-seat regional aircraft ERA. The target of this aircraft is regional air transportation. In the initial stage, it adopts hybrid electric propulsion system, and finally it will adopt all-electric propulsion. Aura and Safran will work together to define propulsion and non-propulsion power system architectures.With the specific energy of 200 ~ 300Wh/kg of existing batteries, ERA may use turbine engine as range extender. The turbine engine runs at a constant optimum speed to directly drive the motor or charge the battery. Usually take-off and landing will be all-electric, and range extender, that is, turbine engine, will be used in cruise phase.Aura is scheduled to make the first flight of ERA in 2024 and be put into use in 2027.The next generation of solid-state batteries is expected to be launched from 2025 to 2030, with a specific energy of 400 ~ 500Wh/kg. This could see 19-seater aircraft adopt an all-electric propulsion system, or at least reduce the use of range extenders, which could be suitable for aircraft upgraded after 2027. Safran will integrate batteries from professional battery suppliers and verify battery performance through several aviation cycles of testing.In the future, Safran and GE may consider introducing electric motors into hybrid turbofan engines. Together with sustainable aviation fuel, it may be an effective way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of narrow-body aircraft."

        "原文": "?\nThe Russian military personnel launched the 61st and the last satellite in the GLONASS-M series for the nation's orbital navigation network. The Soyuz-2-1b/Fregat rocket lifted off from Plesetsk Cosmodrome on Nov. 28, 2022. Slightly more than three and a half hours later, the GLONASS M-61 satellite should be released into its circular orbit about 19,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface.\nGLONASS-M No. 61 mission at a glance:\nSatellite designation(s)\nGLONASS-MNo. 61 (14F113, Kosmos)\nLaunch vehicle\nSoyuz-2-1b, 14A14\nUpper stage\nFregat14S44\nLaunch vehicle payload fairing\n14S737\nLaunch site\nPlesetsk,Site 43, Pad 3\nLaunch date and time\n2022 Nov. 27\nTarget orbital altitude\n~19,000 kilometers\nTarget orbital inclination\n64.8 degrees toward the Equator\nPreparing the mission\nThe GLONASS M-61 satellite was one of three last satellites relying on a pressurized platform to house onboard avionics, before more advanced spacecraft fully equipped with systems capable of operating in the vacuum of space took over the composition of the GLONASS network.\nIn December 2021, the official Russian media reported that the last GLONASS-M was taken out of storage for preparation for launch then expected as early as March 2022. At the time, the particular spacecraft was on the ground for a number of years and its further storage would likely require a refurbishment or cutting its orbital life span. At the same time, the GLONASS-M provided a backup to the new-generation GLONASS-K series, in case there was a problem with their production, in particular due to ban on the supply of space-rated electronics to Russia.\nUpon completion of the series production, one of two available processing facilities for GLONASS-M satellites at ISS Reshetnev in Zheleznogorsk had been dismantled, leaving the second to perform the final launch compaign in 2022, before the company would fully switch its development and testing infrastructure to GLONASS-K and K2 series.\nOn Nov. 15, 2022, Russian authorities issued a warning to air and sea traffic for the launch scheduled between November 27 and 30. Three areas in the Komi Republic, including \"Vashka\" in the Udorsky District and \"Zheleznodorozhny\" between Knyazhpogostky and Kortkerossky Districts, had been declared danger zones. Soon thereafter, another danger area was declared in the Uvatsk District of the Tyumen Republic, where Soyuz rockets lifting off from Plesetsk would typically drop their core stages. The unidentified was expected on November 27, from 17:00 to 19:30 Moscow Time with backup dates on November 28, 29, and 30.\nThe declared areas were typical for drop zones used by several military missions originating from Plesetsk, including GLONASS and Meridian.\nGLONASS-M No. 61 launch profile\nThe liftoff of the Soyuz-2-1b/Fregat-M vehicle with the GLONASS-M No. 61 satellite took place on Nov. 28, 2022, from Site 43 in Plesetsk after a 24-hour delay.\nThe mission likely followed the routine ascent profile of the GLONASS launches. After several seconds of vertical ascent, the launch vehicle headed southeast to reach an orbit with an inclination of 64.77 degrees toward the Equator. The four boosters of the first stage separated around two minutes into the flight and were expected to fall at drop zone S-19 in the eastern section of the Arkhangelsk Region. Around 45 seconds later, as the vehicle left the dense atmosphere, the payload fairing protecting the satellite was commanded to split into two halves and its fragments probably targeted the S-20 drop zone in the Komi Republic of Russia.\nThe second (core) stage of the rocket continued firing until around 4.7 minutes into the flight, separating moments after the ignition of the RD-0124 engine on the third stage. Seconds later, the cylindrical aft section of the third stage split into three segments and separated as well. The core stage and the fragments of the aft section likely fell at the S-21 drop zone in the Omsk Region.\nThe third stage of the rocket completed its powered ascent and separated from the payload section nine minutes and 22 seconds after liftoff. Just short of orbital velocity, the third stage was intended to naturally reenter the Earth's atmosphere near the opposite side of the Earth from the launch site, with its flaming remnants projected to fall into the southern section of the Pacific Ocean.\nShortly after planned liftoff time, the Russian media confirmed the fact of the launch. Quoting a Ministry of Defense announcement, the reports said that the Russian Air and Space Forces, VKS, performed the launch of the Soyuz-2-1b rocket with a military spacecraft at 18:17 Moscow Time (1o:17 a.m. EDT), however, there was no immediate confirmation that ground assets began tracking the vehicle. It did come with another communique several hours after the launch, confirming that the spacecraft had separated from the Fregat upper stage.\nSpace tug maneuvers\nDuring GLONASS missions, the Fregat-M upper stage conducts three orbital maneuvers to deliver the spacecraft to its operational circular orbit more than 19,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface.\nThe first firing of the Fregat's main engine, lasting around 20 seconds, is initiated around a minute after the separation from the third stage. The maneuver inserts the stack into an initial parking orbit and, after a less-than-half-an-hour passive flight, the Fregat fires its main engine again, this time for around 9.5 minutes. The second maneuver stretches the original near-circular orbit, boosting its apogee (highest point) to a target altitude of more than 19,000 kilometers.

By manipulating these sites in the material, often by adding different elements (a process referred to as \"doping\"), designers can elicit different properties.\n\"Defects are unavoidable, even in 'pure' materials,\" says Doug Irving, University Faculty Scholar and professor of materials science and engineering at NC State. \"We want to interface with those spaces via doping to change certain properties of a material.

        "原文": "Scientists at NNL have made a breakthrough for producing Lead-212, a very important medical radioisotope for treating cancer, but which is difficult to produce and therefore in short supply.\nUsed in an emerging medical treatment known as Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT), Lead-212 labelled targeting molecules destroy cancer cells while minimising damage to healthy parts of the body. TATs have gained traction because they fight cancer while limiting the side effects experienced by patients. Yet the supply of Lead-212, like other key medical radioisotopes, faces a global shortage which constrains their use, with no production route in existence in the UK.\nThe production process for the UK’s first home-grown supply of Lead-212 has been developed at NNL’s Preston Laboratory. It is currently going through quality assurance and scale-up work. To achieve this, NNL is working closely with clinicians and academics including at Queen Mary University of London and King’s College London and their associated nuclear medicine departments at St Bartholomew’s Hospital and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust.\nDr Jane Sosabowski is Reader in Molecular Imaging at Queen Mary’s Barts Cancer Institute and researcher at City of London Cancer Research UK-RadNET, one of a network of centres of excellence and state-of-the-art facilities working to tackle the major challenges of radiobiology and radiation oncology. She said:\n“This new initiative is immensely exciting, offering a huge boost to the future of molecular radiotherapy treatment and personalised medicine in the UK. Barts Cancer Institute and Radionuclides for Health UK welcomes the leadership that NNL is showing on this issue. It is an important step in re-establishing UK supply of medical radioisotopes and securing the future of research in this important sphere of human health.”\nDr Paul Howarth, Chief Executive Officer for NNL, said:\n“Fifty years ago, the UK led the world in medical radioisotope research and production, yet today we rely on imports often from ageing facilities. Establishing a sovereign home-grown supply of these important medical radioisotopes would be transformative for healthcare in the UK and, given the global nature of the supply challenge, citizens of the other countries we supply.\n“There is great demand from the healthcare profession for the UK to develop an indigenous supply of medical radioisotopes and this work is core to NNL’s purpose of nuclear science to benefit society.”\nNick Hanigan, NNL’s Health and Nuclear Medicine Director, said:\n“The production process we have developed, which requires complex chemical separation and purification of nuclear material, builds on NNL’s world-leading capability in this area. Lead-212 limits the side effects of cancer treatment because it is delivered directly to cancerous cells. Our plan now is to scale the production route in order to remove the significant supply constraints currently faced by hospitals.\n“This breakthrough development is a single aspect of our work on medical radioisotopes, a tool used on a daily basis by every hospital in the UK to diagnose and treat health conditions including many types of cancer, heart disease and thyroid disease and for the early detection and assessment of brain disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.”\n",

These new structures lead to new opportunities both from scientific and technological standpoints.\"\nA leader in nanochemistry, Mirkin is also a professor of chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and a professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\nMirkin's team has been using the programmability of DNA to synthesize crystals with unusual and useful properties for over two decades; broadening the concept to include hollow particles is a big step toward a more universal approach to understanding and controlling colloidal crystal formation.\nNature usescolloidal crystalsto control colors of organisms, including butterfly wings and the changeable color in the skin of a chameleon. Mirkin's laboratory-generated structures—especially the porous ones, through which molecules, materials and even light can travel—will challenge scientists and engineers to create new devices from them.\nVinayak Dravid, the Abraham Harris Professor of Materials Science and Engineering in McCormick and an author on the paper, added that many industrial chemical processes rely on zeolites, another class of synthetic porous materials.\n\"There are many limitations to zeolites because these are made by physical rules that limit options,\" Dravid said. \"But when DNA is used as a bond, it allows for a greater diversity of structures and much larger variety of pore sizes, and thus a diverse range of properties.\"\nThe ability to control pore size and connections between pores opens a range of potential uses. For example, the authors show that porous superlattices exhibit an interesting optical behavior called anegative refractive indexnot found in nature and only accessible with engineered materials.\n\"In this work, we discovered how open-channel superlattices can be new types of optical metamaterials that allow for a negative index of refraction,\" said Koray Aydin, also an author on the paper and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering in McCormick. \"Such metamaterials enable exciting applications such as cloaking and superlensing, the imaging of super small objects with microscopy.\"\nThe researchers are continuing to collaborate to drive the work forward.\n\"We need to apply these new design rules to nanoporous metallic structures made of others metals, like aluminum, and we need to scale the process,\" Mirkin said. \"These practical considerations are very important in the context of high-performance optical devices. Such an advance could be truly transformative.\"Although tremendous advances have been made in preparing porous crystals from molecular precursors1,2 , there are no general ways of designing and making topologically diversifed porous colloidal crystals over the 10–1,000?nm length scale. Control over porosity in this size range would enable the tailoring of molecular absorption and storage, separation, chemical sensing, catalytic and optical properties of such materials. Here, a universal approach for synthesizing metallic open-channel superlattices with pores of 10 to 1,000?nm from DNA-modifed hollow colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) is reported.\nBy tuning hollow NP geometry and DNA design, one can adjust crystal pore geometry (pore size and shape) and channel topology (the way in which pores are interconnected). The assembly of hollow NPs is driven by edge-to-edge rather than face-to-face DNA–DNA interactions. Two new design rules describing this assembly regime emerge from these studies and are then used to synthesize 12 open-channel superlattices with control over crystal symmetry, channel geometry and topology. The open channels can be selectively occupied by guests of the appropriate size and that are modifed with complementary DNA (for example, Au NPs).\nPorous crystals are a class of materials with extraordinary properties, including high surface areas and low densities, that can be engineered to physically absorb and chemically interact with guest species of known size, shape and chemical functionality2–15. Porous colloidal materials are a particularly interesting class of such structures, as they provide access to inverse photonic structures, which can be used for optics, energy storage and biological applications16. These structures are typically made by templating processes17, a strategy that often relies on face-centred cubic crystals made from spherical particles as templates; this limits the possible pore topologies and the distribution of pore volumes.\nAlthough reticular chemical synthesis based on metal ions and bridging-ligand building blocks has led to significant advances in the realization of porous materials (pore apertures less than 10?nm), and design rules now exist for the construction of such materials at the molecular scale18–20, it is still remarkably difficult to prepare porous crystals with customized pore topologies and pore sizes in the range between 10?nm and 1??m. We hypothesized that three-dimensional (3D) metallic hollow nanoparticles (NPs) (nanoframes (NFs) and nanocages (NCs)) could be assembled into open-channel superlattices using colloidal crystal engineering with DNA, an approach that thus far has yielded access to over 70 different crystal symmetries via well-established design rules based on the complementary contact model (CCM, the notion that DNA-modified building blocks will arrange themselves in space to maximize complementary interactions)21–23. Indeed, consistent with the CCM model23, we determined that the attractive DNA hybridization interactions between the edges of adjacent NFs lead to the formation of ordered superlattices. Notably, this registry-driven edge-to-edge assembly mode (edge-bonding) is distinct from the canonical face-to-face interactions (face packing) that typically govern the assembly outcomes of solid NPs24. It should be noted that an approach that relies on the crystallization of DNA origami subunits25,26 has been developed, and although this method enables access to certain crystal structures through vertex-to-vertex bonding, it yields structures that are limited in pore dimension (typical unit size less than 50?nm).\nImportantly, herein we introduce two new design rules that summarize this edge-bonding construction strategy, by means of which 12 new open-channel superlattices are synthesized. These structures have symmetries, pore geometries and topologies that can be deliberately tuned through the choice of hollow NPs and DNA. These openchannel metallic superlattices not only have the potential to exhibit unnatural optical properties that make them attractive as optical metamaterials, but also can be useful for localizing large guests for a variety of applications, including biomolecular absorption and storage, separation, chemical sensing and catalysis.\nConclusion\nWe have presented a new edge-bonding approach to design and synthesize open-channel superlattices using hollow NPs with pore sizes over the 10 to 1,000?nm length scale. The DNA-mediated assembly of hollow NPs offers a potential opportunity to construct negative refractive index metamaterials from the bottom up. Looking forward, functional materials (such as quantum dots, proteins and viruses) can be strategically localized in the open channels, potentially offering routes to composite architectures that could have an impact in a broad range of fields spanning catalysis, plasmonics, electronics and biology.\n",

The new design rules of assembly are described in the study. Researchers use metal nano-hollow particles and modify them with appropriate DNA sequences. As a result, open channel superlattices with 10 to 1000 nanometers can be synthesized. It is very difficult to fabricate such size channels. Twelve unique porous nanoparticle superlattice structures have been identified in the study, which can control the geometry, symmetry and pore connectivity, and can be used as a way to fabricate new materials. The research results were published in the journal Nature.Porous crystals are a kind of materials with high surface area and low density, which can be designed as functional materials for physical absorption and chemical action. These structures are usually made according to templates, which are usually face-centered cubic crystals made of spherical particles, which limits the topological structure and volume distribution of pores.For this new type of hollow nanocrystals, the existing crystal engineering rules can not fully guide them. It is found that by adjusting the geometry of hollow nanoparticles and DNA design, the geometry of crystal pores and the topological structure of channels can be adjusted. For example, the assembly of nanoparticles driven by \"edge bonding\" can obtain a wide range of crystal structures, but the structures obtained at present cannot be obtained by traditional \"surface bonding\" methods. These new structures bring new development opportunities from the perspective of science and technology. For more than 20 years, the team has been using the programmability of DNA to synthesize crystals with special properties, and then extended this concept to the application of hollow particles, thus becoming an important step in understanding and controlling the formation of colloidal crystals.It is worth noting that the team also discovered new optical metamaterials with negative refractive index through open channel superlattices, which laid the foundation for the application of stealth materials. Looking forward to the future, this new discovery on pore channel control method can provide more preparation ways for composite structures, thus greatly promoting the development of functional materials. It is expected to be used in super-surface stealth, molecular absorption, storage, chemical sensing and catalysis, and has a wide impact on nanotechnology and other fields."

The company implemented and tested successfully a software enhancement with its proven MSSR 2000 ID secondary radar that allows for precise tracking of aircraft in addition to the conventional surveillance mode of Identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) systems. A so-called “stop & stare mode” allows GBAD systems to process identification tracks in specific sectors in near-realtime and very precisely.\nThe new feature uses electronic beam steering and automatized antenna control in order enable the user to progress from the rather ordinary surveillance operation to a very focused lock-on and track mode. Thereby, distinction between friendly and hostile forces is substantially accelerated and thus the protection of forces on the ground considerably improved.\nIFF systems precisely identify aircraft by automatically sending interrogation signals which are answered by transponders on-board friendly aircraft. Thus, IFF enables field commanders to distinguish friendly from hostile forces and helps avoiding friendly fire incidents. The most recent “Mode 5” IFF systems like MSSR 2000 ID employ sophisticated encryption techniques to avoid hostile signal manipulation, thus ensuring that the identification process is absolutely reliable and secure.\nHENSOLDT is an expert in Mode 5 IFF. It is under contract to upgrade German, French and UK armed forces’ IFF systems to the “Mode 5” standard and has delivered IFF systems – including crypto devices - for ground and naval applications of several NATO and partner nations. Among others, the company’s equipment is deployed on all German Navy ships as well as several UK Royal Navy and Royal Norwegian Navy ships.

Eric Felt, director of space architecture and integration, said Jan. 11.\n“I have never in my 25 years of service seen the department move so much money so fast toward priorities that the secretary laid out. That’s exciting,” Felt said at the “State of the Space Industrial Base” webinar hosted by the National Defense Industrial Association.\nFelt said his boss, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition and integration Frank Calvelli, is pushing the message across the Space Force that staying ahead technologically is not just about spending more but spending smarter. Part of that strategy is avoiding costly government development programs and tapping commercially available technologies. \n“What’s so exciting to the Space Force and the space acquisition community about all this commercial innovation is that we can use it to maintain our technology lead, and deter conflict with our competitors,” said Felt. With regard to space systems, “we see solutions that are going to help us get after that problem and really deliver the kinds of capabilities that our warfighters need.”\nFelt noted that how the Pentagon spends its space dollars can have a significant impact on the health of the industry. “The things that we do in space acquisition can be super helpful to our industrial base or super harmful to our industrial base,” he said, as a healthy space sector is important for national security and for the economy.\nCalvelli has been insistent about the need for speed in acquisitions, and that goes along with the idea of using more commercial technologies, and building smaller satellites, said Felt. \n“His formula for going faster in acquisition starts with smaller systems, and that includes buying more commercial systems … That is a big thrust of what we’re doing,” he added. \nThese rules were laid out by Calvelli in an Oct. 31 memo that procurement offices are “now figuring out how to implement,” said Felt.\nFollowing this new direction, he said, “I think will be very healthy for the Space Force and healthy for the industry as well.”\n‘We need to invest properly’\nSteve “Bucky” Butow, director of the space portfolio at the Defense Innovation Unit, said DoD needs to spend wisely on commercial products and services, and that means awarding “meaningful contracts” that benefit the government and the private sector. \n“What we really want is a strong commercial space industrial base that supports not just the military but our economic security, and our exploration efforts with NASA,” Butow said at the NDIA webinar. \n“Prototyping, experimentation and validation of space capabilities is an area that traditionally has been underfunded,” he said. “It’s getting better. But if we want to have robust capabilities, we really need to make sure that we’re investing properly in research and development, to include prototyping activities that we do with commercial companies that are doing really interesting things to give the U.S. a competitive advantage in space.”\n“The next thing is meaningful contracts,” he said. \n“That extends to not just procurement of widgets, but services. Services contracts are not normally done in the Department of Defense. But most of the interesting things that are going to be offered in space are going to be available as commercial services. And we really need the U.S. Space Force to be the executive agent for the entire department to make a wide variety of services available.”\nNeed metrics of success\nA concern for DoD in the great power competition with China is how to measure success, warned Richard “Doc” Klodnicki, president and CEO of the consulting firm Aereti Inc.\nWhen experts try to handicap the space race, too much emphasis is placed on the number of space launches, or on how many exploration vehicles and satellites each country sends to orbit, Klodnicki noted. \n“I would caution against focusing on what China is doing versus what it is we want to do,” he said. “I’m not so sure that number of launches is always the right metric.” \nIf satellites are being launched to replace existing assets, “that’s not innovation, that’s operations, maintenance and sustainment,” he said. “I think we need to start looking at what are the metrics of interest that we’re using, and how are we then moving those forward.”\nThe U.S. needs to figure out what success means “without regard to what China’s doing, but rather with regard to what the United States and its allied partners want to accomplish, and that will force China to have to follow too.”\n",

The above plan provides a good opportunity for commercial innovation and the development of space industry by encouraging technological innovation of commercial companies through investment.Felt, director of the Space Architecture Integration Department, said that the government has never invested a lot of money in the development priorities put forward by the Air Force so quickly. The decision-making of government agencies is very important for national security and economic development, the investment of Pentagon has a key impact on the healthy development of the industry, and space procurement is very important for the development of the space industry. The space procurement department is speeding up the procurement strategy of purchasing the minimum mission system to use commercial technology to build smaller satellites.Steve Bhutto, director of the Department of Defense Innovation, said the Defense Department needs rational investment in commercial products and services, awarding contracts that make sense to governments and commercial companies. The development of space technology is complicated, and the previous investment has insufficient support for prototype development, experiment and verification. However, if you want to have a strong space capability, you need to ensure that you invest appropriate funds and carry out prototype development together with commercial companies, which is not limited to purchasing hardware, but also purchasing commercial services for the use of the space army. To measure a country's space competitiveness, we should not unilaterally emphasize the number of space launches, probes and satellites, but focus on the goals and objectives of competitors."

By integrating the building blocks into self-healing building materials, scientists could reduce the amount of maintenance needed and extend a material’s life and usefulness.\nLead authorProfessor Tom Ellisof theDepartment of Bioengineeringat Imperial said: “In the past we’ve created living materials with inbuilt sensors that can detect environmental cues and changes. Now we’ve created living materials that can detect damage and respond to it by healing themselves.”\nIn the same way that architecture uses modular pieces that can be assembled into a variety of building structures, this research demonstrates that the same principle can be applied to the design and construction of bacterial cellulose-based materials.\nTo create ELMs, the researchers genetically engineered bacteria calledKomagataeibacter rhaeticusto have them produce fluorescent 3D sphere-shaped cell cultures, known as spheroids, and to give them sensors which detect damage. They arranged the spheroids into different shapes and patterns, demonstrating the potential of spheroids as modular building blocks.\nThey used a hole punch to damage a thick layer of bacterial cellulose - the scaffold-like material made by some bacteria on which ELMs are produced.

We are not only trying to emulate those systems, but engineer biology to have additional features that are more amenable to the needs we seek without direct intervention. Ultimately, we want to increase the lifetime of a product, prevent failures of systems before the problem is visible to the naked eye and have the material think for itself.”\nPatterns and 3D shapes made from the spheroids\nThe next step for this group of researchers is to develop new spheroid building blocks with different properties, such as combining them with materials like cotton, graphite and gelatins to create more complex designs.

At a Chinese shipyard, the keel-laying ceremony was held for a barge that will later be fitted with two RITM-200S reactors.\nThe keel laying ceremony (Image: Atomenergomash)\nThe barge will measure 140 metres long and 30 metres wide, said Rosatom, and will feature structures for containment and radioactive waste storage as well as fuel tanks for diesel, according to previous TASS reports. On delivery to Atomenergomash by the end of next year the barge will weigh 9549 tons and when fitted out with two RITM-200S pressurised water reactors and all the equipment it needs to function as a power plant it will weigh some 19,088 tons. The reactor components are already being manufactured.\nAtomflot will then take control as the owner and operator of the floating nuclear power plant when it is complete. It will be transferred to Cape Nagloynyn in the Russian Arctic where it will supply 105 MWe to a new port and the forthcoming Baimskaya copper and gold mine. This is scheduled to happen by 2027.\nIn total, the Baimskaya development requires around 300 MWe, therefore three such floating power plants are needed, while a fourth will be installed as backup for outages during refuelling and maintenance.\nAndrey Nikipelov, head of Atomenergomash said: \"This project begins the history of a whole family of floating nuclear power plants, different in capacity and purpose - in the Arctic and tropical versions, which Atomenergomash is ready to offer to the market and which undoubtedly have a very serious potential for the implementation of large industrial projects and exports.\"\nRussia already has one floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, which is stationed at Pevek where it supplies heat and power to the town. This is based on two KLT-40S reactors generating 35 MWe each, which are similar to those used in a previous generation of nuclear powered icebreakers. So-called 'modernised floating nuclear power plants' like the ones for Cape Nagloynyn feature reactors from the new RITM series, as used in the latest generation of icebreakers. RITM units can also be used on land and a single-reactor plant is planned for Ust-Kuyga in Russia's far east.\nNo specific name was given to the new barge, and the overall project comprising four floating power plants and eight reactors is known simply as Cape Nagloynyn.

Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., said last year that the proliferation of small, cheap drones is the “most concerning tactical development” since the rise of the improvised explosive device in Iraq.\nBoth the Army and the Air Force have been working to bolster their counter-SUAS efforts, with the Air Force’s 386th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron developing seminars to provide guidance on how to handle threats from such drones.\n“The seminars are a one-on-one opportunity for general leadership to understand what our capabilities are,” Staff Sgt. Daniel Butts, the NCO in charge of counter-SUAS for the 386th ESFS, said in an Air Force press release. “These systems provide real time video or a picture and now leadership has a better understanding of what others could use it for.”\n“We call it the ‘kill chain’….detect, track, identify and defeat,” Butts said. “The main thing is detecting so we’re able to see it and track it. Once we’re able to track it, we’re going to identify it, which is key to helping us understand if it’s hostile or not and to what extent.

        "原文": "US Navy has installed its first Phillips Additive Hybrid metal 3D printing solution on board powered by metal 3D printer developer Meltio and Haas.\nThe Phillips Additive Hybrid powered by Haas incorporated Meltio’s laser metal deposition technology with the Haas CNC vertical machining centers which regulate the mill onboard the USS Bataan ship. Rear Adm. Brendan McLane, the Commander, of Naval Surface Force Atlantic, said, “The introduction of additive manufacturing (AM) into naval operations supports readiness and self-sufficiency.”\nHow is the US Navy benefitting from this partnership?\nThis new project is a step closer to illustrating an industrial-scale useful application in the maritime sector, thanks to Meltio’s accessible wire-laser metal 3D printing technology. Meltio has worked with Haas on other hybrid system projects in various sectors and countries. The Hybrid system is capable of both additive and subtractive manufacturing. The US Navy is combining these technologies in this project for the USS Bataan ship.\nThe Phillips Additive Hybrid system, which incorporates a Meltio wire-laser metal deposition head on a Haas TM-1 computer numerical control mill, was installed as part of a collaborative initiative between both the Commander, the Naval Surface Force Atlantic, and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Technology Office. The Haas TM-1 framework has demonstrated its reliability in afloat environments aboard numerous aircraft carriers. When combined with the Haas TM-1, the Meltio deposition head offers both additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities within one system, boosting efficiency and lowering waste when compared to conventional machining.\nBy permanently implementing the first metal 3D printer onboard a ship, the US Navy enhanced efforts to increase self-sufficiency for equipped ships and crews and decrease supply chain timeframes by harnessing additive manufacturing. Engineers will use additive manufacturing to integrate multiple materials to produce components from 3D model data, typically layer upon layer, as compared to subtractive and formative manufacturing methodologies.\nThe Phillips Additive Hybrid system prints 316L stainless steel, which is commonly used in US Navy ship systems. Although stainless steel additive manufacturing onboard naval ships is recent, it represents a significant step forward in offering mariners with industrial-level manufacturing functionalities to print individual components for systems that were previously unavailable without purchasing the overall system at a considerably higher cost.\nThe benefits of Meltio’s Engine 3D printing are twofold; it increases operational availability while decreasing demand on conventional and Navy-specific supply chains. Moreover, NAVSEA engineers implemented a second 3D printer onboard Bataan to create polymer (plastic) parts. This printer allows the ship’s crew to print any of the 300+ AM Technical Data Packages created by NAVSEA, which describe the necessary design configuration and processes to produce a component and guarantee it functions properly.\n“These printers have the ability to help the Navy overcome both obsolescence issues for ships and systems that have service lives measured in decades and directly contribute to enhanced operational availability of our systems and ships,” said NAVSEA Chief Engineer Rear Adm. Jason Lloyd.\n",

        "原文": "1/3/2023 ByStew Magnuson\nPALMDALE, California —Just after dusk on Dec. 2 — to the sound of swelling music and applause from thousands of workers and dignitaries — Northrop Grumman employees removed a white shroud from the B-21 Raider and tugged it out of its hangar for the whole world to see. Most of the aircraft anyway. About one-fourth of the bomber — the tail-end specifically — was kept inside Air Force Hangar 42 to prevent overhead intelligence from seeing the aft section, a crucial part of the overall system that gives the aircraft its stealth capabilities. However, it was overcast, so prying spy satellites couldn’t have seen much anyway. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III in a speech after the unveiling said the B-21 “is a testament to America’s enduring advantages in ingenuity and innovation. And it’s proof of the department’s long-term commitment to building advanced capabilities that will fortify America’s ability to deter aggression today and into the future.” The B-21 Raider is being called a “sixth-generation aircraft” and is designed as a low-observable, or stealthy, strategic bomber that can penetrate air defenses and deliver nuclear or conventional weapons deep in enemy territory and return undetected to a base in the United States. Despite revealing the nation’s newest long-range strategic bomber to the public for the first time, this is still a top-secret program, as Northrop Grumman executives and Air Force personnel reminded reporters in a series of briefings throughout the day. What is the wingspan? They couldn’t say. What is the aircraft’s range? Can’t tell you. How much do you think each aircraft will cost taxpayers? That’s classified. Yet the company and government representatives did have a good news story to tell: namely, how industry and the Air Force went from signing a contract in 2015 to having six prototypes in various stages of production in a little more than seven years. Test flights are expected to begin sometime in 2023 — meaning the program could go from concept to flight in eight years. Northrop Grumman is aiming to deliver the first Raiders to the Air Force by the middle of the 2020s. The first squadron will be located at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. “We are taking technology from the future and bringing it to the here and now,” Kathy Warden, Northrop Grumman president and CEO, said in a press briefing prior to the aircraft’s debut. “It’s not just about what the technology advancement of the aircraft means, but it’s also about how we went about developing this aircraft.” The B-21 was a digitally designed bomber from day one, meaning the company abandoned the traditional means of designing aircraft on paper, CAD files and clay models and embraced the new era of digital engineering. The technique uses computer modeling and data that represent the characteristics of complex systems. Engineers can run component tests on computer simulations rather than building real-world equivalents, which takes time and money. Developers can then create an entire computer-simulated aircraft — what’s known as a “digital twin” — on which to run tests. “We iterated on thousands of designs for this aircraft in a digital environment before selecting the design that would go forward,” Warden said. The Air Force chose a wing-shaped design, similar to the first stealth bomber, the B-2 Spirit, also built by Northrop Grumman. “It’s going to change the way we do things here in the future,” Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles “CQ” Brown said of the digital engineering revolution. The all-digital open architecture will also make the aircraft more adaptable, said Andrew Hunter, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics. The B-21 is designed to penetrate today’s air defenses. But potential opponents will inevitably improve their radars and other sensors. The Air Force will be able to perform upgrades to the electronic systems to keep up with them. “As the missions that we have to perform change, and as the threat evolves, the B-21 will continue to be able to perform that mission for the long term,” Hunter said. “Digital engineering and digital tools have enabled us to iterate the designs, get to tests faster and do more testing before we actually fly the airplane,” said a source with intimate knowledge of the program who provided reporters with background information. “It has enabled us to make the first production airplane. That reduces risk as we go into production,” the source said. Tony Nolls, B-21 build lead at Northrop Grumman, said a great deal of work went into creating the digital models. Company employees are in two primary sites, Palmdale and Melbourne, Florida. Maintainers, pilots, manufacturing experts, engineers and Air Force personnel all worked together on the model, he said. Everyone — no matter where they were physically located — was connected to a virtual room where work proceeded, even during the worst part of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We didn’t have to wait to share information. We shared live. All the walls were down. Everybody saw [a problem] as it happened and we dealt with it immediately,” he said. “We were solving problems that weren’t even problems yet,” he added. Today, technicians are using augmented reality goggles as they put the prototypes together. They can see things that are there and that are not there but will go in a certain spot in the future. And when doing inspections, the AR helps them understand where every component is supposed to go, Nolls said. All these new digital engineering techniques will upend the way future programs are developed, Brown said. There just aren’t as many “test points” needed, which speeds the process up, but might upset the traditionalists, particularly in the test and evaluation community. “This is a cultural shift as well … for our test community. They like testing,” Brown said. After the Raiders go into production and are sent to the Air Force for operations, the open architecture will keep them relevant, the source said. “Our adversaries are always changing, always improving. We’re always trying to stay one step ahead of them and that is what the B-21 allows us to do,” he said. The ability to rapidly swap out both software and hardware will make the aircraft more flexible, the source said. The aircraft will evolve. “It will be the most advanced aircraft today, but with what we have built in, it will continue to be for the next 30 to 50 years,” the source said. In addition, maintainability has been a key requirement from the start, he said. The Air Force and Navy in recent years have struggled to keep their aircraft fleets operable due to parts shortages and obsolescence, lack of maintainers and other problems. “The key here is you have to have an aircraft that is maintainable and is a daily flyer for the United States Air Force,” he added. Next will be runway tests where the B-21 will roll down the tarmac without taking off. Two pilots will be in the cockpit for those tests, one employed by Northrop Grumman, the other an Air Force officer. They both have been deeply involved in the development of the B-21, particularly in matters important to those who will be flying the aircraft. “One of the key tenets of the program has been risk reduction, and really focusing on doing as much of that testing upfront to reduce the risk before we go into flight testing,” said Lt. Col. Clifton Bell, head of testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Chris Moss, Northrop Grumman’s test pilot, said the pair have been working extensively on a high-fidelity simulator for the past six months that allows them to evaluate the aircraft, get comfortable with how it handles, understand the flight control systems, and how they work on the aircraft. Using the simulator helps them understand the difference between something going wrong, and the way the aircraft is supposed to operate. “We spend a lot of time on simulators working on that,” Moss said. Despite the digital engineering push, some real-word testing is being conducted aboard a flying testbed, which is a business jet that can carry components and instruments, Bell said. “We’re flying with the systems before the B-21 has actually flown yet,” Moss said. Along with being a less expensive alternative, the test?bed allows them to find and fix problems before the components are integrated on the Raider, he added. They have also used one of the six prototypes in production to do load calibration and to test the structural strength of the airframe, he added. Bell said during testing, “You always expect to have some sort of discovery, and it’s just that process of if you discover something, you compare it to what you’ve found in the model, and then you go update whatever you need to update and then you keep pressing forward,” he said. “We use lessons learned all the time from other flight test programs,” Moss said. “What did they miss? Where do we need to look? What kind of things did they not think was a problem and ended up being a big problem? Because a lot of times the things that surprised you the most are little things that you didn’t think would have any issues at all.” Still, a high-fidelity simulator is no substitute for the real, upcoming test flights, Moss said. “We can’t validate the model until we actually go and fly. So, all we can do is be prepared for everything that we think may be a problem, or could be a problem,” he said. As for when the B-21 leaves Air Force Hangar 42 and takes to the sky, officials are aiming for mid-2023, but say that is not engraved in stone. The source familiar with the program said the timing of the B-21’s first flight will be “data driven.” Tests during the beginning of the year will be key. First will be runway only tests, where the B-21 will taxi at high and low speeds, he said. “We kind of have a saying that ‘the airplane is the boss,’ and the airplane will fly when it’s ready to fly,” he said.\n",
        "中文原文": "1/3/2023 ByStew Magnuson加州棕榈谷--12月2日黄昏刚过--在数千名工人和政要的隆隆音乐声和掌声中--诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的员工从B-21突袭机上取下白色裹尸布，并将其拖出机库，让全世界都看到。反正大部分的飞机。大约四分之一的轰炸机--特别是尾端--被保存在空军42号机库内，以防止头顶情报人员看到后部，后部是赋予飞机隐身能力的整个系统的关键部分。然而，当时阴云密布，所以窥探的间谍卫星无论如何也不可能看到太多。国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀三世在揭幕后的一次讲话中说，B-21“证明了美国在独创性和创新方面的持久优势”。这证明了国防部长期致力于建设先进的能力，这些能力将加强美国今天和未来遏制侵略的能力。B-21突袭机被称为“第六代飞机”，被设计为一种低可观察性或隐身的战略轰炸机，可以穿透防空，在敌人领土深处投送核武器或常规武器，并在不被发现的情况下返回美国基地。尽管首次向公众披露了美国最新的远程战略轰炸机，但这仍然是一个绝密项目，正如诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的高管和空军人员在一整天的一系列简报中提醒记者的那样。翼展是多少？他们不能说。飞机的航程是多少？不能告诉你。你认为每架飞机会花费纳税人多少钱？那是机密。然而，该公司和政府代表确实有一个好消息要讲：即工业界和空军是如何在7年多一点的时间里从2015年签署合同到拥有6架处于不同生产阶段的原型机的。试飞预计将于2023年某个时候开始--这意味着该计划可能在八年内从概念到飞行。诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的目标是在2020年代中期向空军交付第一批突袭机。第一中队将设在南达科他州的埃尔斯沃思空军基地。诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司总裁兼首席执行官凯西·沃登（Kathy Warden）在飞机首次亮相前的新闻发布会上表示：“我们正在从未来获取技术，并将其带到此时此地。”“这不仅仅是关于飞机的技术进步意味着什么，也是关于我们如何开发这架飞机。”B-21从第一天起就是一架数字化设计的轰炸机，这意味着该公司放弃了在纸上、CAD文件和粘土模型上设计飞机的传统手段，拥抱了数字工程的新时代。该技术使用计算机建模和数据来表示复杂系统的特征。工程师可以在计算机模拟上运行组件测试，而不是构建真实世界的等效组件，这需要时间和金钱。然后，开发人员可以创建一个完整的计算机模拟飞机--即所谓的“数字孪生”--在上面进行测试。沃登说：“在选择未来的设计之前，我们在数字环境中迭代了这架飞机的数千种设计。”空军选择了机翼形状的设计，类似于同样由诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司制造的第一架隐形轰炸机B-2勇气号。空军参谋长查尔斯·布朗将军在谈到数字工程革命时说：“这将改变我们未来在这里做事的方式。”负责采购、技术和后勤的空军助理部长安德鲁·亨特（Andrew Hunter）表示，全数字开放架构也将使飞机更具适应性。B-21的设计是为了穿透今天的防空系统。但是潜在的对手将不可避免地改进他们的雷达和其他传感器。空军将能够对电子系统进行升级，以跟上它们。亨特说：“随着我们必须执行的任务的变化，随着威胁的发展，B-21将继续能够长期执行这项任务。”“数字工程和数字工具使我们能够迭代设计，更快地进行测试，并在真正驾驶飞机之前进行更多测试，”一位向记者提供背景信息的了解该项目的消息人士表示。“它使我们能够制造第一架生产性飞机。这降低了我们投产时的风险，“消息人士说。诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司B-21建造负责人托尼·诺尔斯说，在创建数字模型方面做了大量工作。公司员工在两个主要地点，棕榈谷和墨尔本，佛罗里达州。他说，维修人员、飞行员、制造专家、工程师和空军人员都在该模型上共同努力。每个人--无论他们在哪里--都被连接到一个虚拟的房间里，在那里工作，即使是在新冠肺炎疫情最糟糕的时候",

Digital engineering can realize the cooperative work of research teams in different places, speed up aircraft development and reduce development risks. The researchers said that the real flight test will be carried out in the follow-up as a supplement to the virtual test. In addition, the aircraft also adopts an all-digital open architecture, which makes the aircraft more adaptable and can continuously upgrade the electronic system to cope with potential adversary threats."

The details of the Energia family, the latest in the company’s Sustainability in Action initiative, were broadcast live via YouTube from Embraer’s manufacturing facility in S?o José dos Campos.\nThe company has partnered with an international consortium of engineering universities, aeronautical research institutes, and small and medium-sized enterprises to better understand energy harvesting, storage, thermal management and their applications for sustainable aircraft propulsion.\nThe Energia Family is comprised of four concept aircraft of varying sizes that incorporate different propulsion technologies – electric, hydrogen fuel cell, dual fuel gas turbine, and hybrid-electric.\nEnergia Hybrid (E9-HE)\nl hybrid-electric propulsion\nl up to 90% CO2 emissions reduction\nl 9 seats\nl rear-mounted engines\nl technology readiness –2030\nEnergia Electric (E9-FE)\nl full electric propulsion\nl zero CO2 emissions\nl 9 seats\nl aft contra-rotating propeller\nl technology readiness – 2035\nEnergia H2 Fuel Cell (E19-H2FC)\nl hydrogen electric propulsion\nl zero CO2 emissions\nl 19 seats\nl rear-mounted electric engines\nl technology readiness – 2035\nEnergia H2 Gas Turbine (E50-H2GT)\nl hydrogen or SAF/JetA urbine propulsion\nl up to 100% CO2 emissions reduction\nl 35 to 50 seats\nl rear-mounted engines\nl technology readiness – 2040\nEach aircraft is being evaluated for its technical and subsequent commercial viability.\nLuis Carlos Affonso, Embraer’s Sr. VP of Engineering, Technology and Corporate Strategy, explained the rationale for the Energia family. “We see our role as a developer of novel technologies to help the industry achieve its sustainability targets. There’s no easy or single solution in getting to net zero. New technologies and their supporting infrastructure will come online over time. We’re working right now to refine the first airplane concepts, the ones that can start reducing emissions sooner rather than later. Small aircraft are ideal on which to test and prove new propulsion technologies so that they can be scaled up to larger aircraft. That’s why our Energia family is such an important platform.”\nArjan Meijer, President and CEO of Embraer Commercial Aviation, commented on the company?s strategy regarding sustainability “We will see a big transformation in our industry towards a more sustainable aviation. With 50 years’ experience in developing, certifying and supporting regional aircraft, Embraer is in a unique position to make viable the introduction of new disruptive green technologies.”\nAlthough the Energia airplanes are still on the drawing board, Embraer has already made advances in reducing emissions from its aircraft. It has tested drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), mixes of sugarcane and camelina plant-derived fuel and fossil fuel, on its family of E-Jets. The company is targeting to have all Embraer aircraft SAF-compatible by 2030. Last August, Embraer flew its Electric Demonstrator, a single-engine EMB-203 Ipanema, 100% powered by electricity. A hydrogen fuel cell demonstrator is planned for 2025 and the company’s eVTOL, a fully electric, zero-emissions vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, is being developed to enter service in 2026.\n",

        "原文": "The Directed Energy Maneuver Short-Range Air Defensewill participate in the Project Convergence 21 exercise this fall, according to Lt. Gen. Neil Thurgood, director of the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office.\nThe Army also recently completed a shoot-off with the DE M-SHORAD, Thurgood said in an Aug. 11 speech at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium.\n\"The young soldiers love this thing,\" he said. At a demonstration of the prototypes, soldiers were able to learn the controls for the system in under an hour, while Thurgood took closer to six hours.\nA platoon with four prototypes of DE M-SHORAD will be fielded to Europe in fiscal year 2022, where they will be part of a battery with the kinetic M-SHORAD systems. Both systems are based on the Stryker combat vehicle, and the directed energy variant has a 50-kilowatt solid-state laser that can shoot down enemy drones, rockets and mortars.\nManagement of the program will transition from RCCTO to the Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space in FY-23, Thurgood said.\nRCCTO has helped prove the Army can still develop and field new technologies quickly, through a collapse of traditional bureaucratic structures and increased engagement with other stakeholders, he said.\n\"We can do hard things, and we can do hard things quickly,\" Thurgood said.\nIn addition, RCCTO's rapid prototyping programs do not require as much bureaucratic approval to move forward, he said.RCCTO reports to the Army secretary and under secretary, the service's acquisition executive, the chief and vice chief of staff and the leader of Army Futures Command.\nThe office implemented a greater level of transparency with contractors on the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon program, Thurgood said. He presented more detailed plans and budgets to contractors than programs normally do during development.\nContractors were required to be more transparent with the Army, in turn, with regard to their budgets and timelines for the program, he said. Industry resisted these efforts at first, but they have since complied.\nThe first battery of eight LRHWs remains on track to be fielded by FY-23, which will be a little more than four years after the program was assigned to RCCTO, Thurgood said. The Army has begun calling LRHW the \"Dark Eagle\" program.\nSoldiers have already tested and practiced with the equipment that will be used for the LRHW during more than 1,000 hours of soldier touch points, he said. Soldier testing has been central to the rapid prototyping approach at both RCCTO and Army Futures Command.\nThe Army plans three test flights of the LRHW's Common Glide Body before the first battery is fielded, a service official said during an Aug. 10 panel at the Space and Missile Defense Symposium.\nRCCTO remains on pace to deliver the first battery of the Medium Range Capability in FY-23, Thurgood said. That system will use both the Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles from the Navy, and the launcher will be compatible with the Army's Patriot missile, Precision Strike Missile and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System.\nThe SM-6 in the MRC can act as either an offensive or defensive weapon. After the military accomplishes its current goals of combining offensive and defensive command-and-control systems, missiles that can fill both roles could become a focus of development, Thurgood said.\nBoth the LRHW and MRC programs will transition from RCCTO to PEO Missiles and Space in FY-24, he said. To aid the transition, most of the program staffers in RCCTO will move to the PEO for each program.\n",

        "原文": "Airbus has finished the third instrument for the Sentinel-1 satellite series. It features a world premiere of a new separation mechanism which will help avoid space debris. The C-band radar for the Copernicus Sentinel-1C satellite, is now on its way to “meet” its spacecraft at Thales Alenia Space facilities in Rome, Italy, where it will undergo integration and testing. The satellite is scheduled for launch in the first half of 2023. \nThe C-band radar beam the instrument produces can determine changes in the Earth’s surface with an accuracy of a few millimetres, supplying imagery for maritime and land monitoring, emergency response, climate change and security. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or a lack of illumination and can acquire data over a site during the day or night in all weather conditions.

        "原文": "NEWSAVIATIONPRESS RELEASES\nByDylan Malyasov\nDec 14, 2021\nModified date:4 seconds ago\nThe U.S. Air Force’s Air Combat Command announced Monday that the first operational unit being used the next-generation smart munition on its fighter jets.\nThe 391st Fighter Squadron became the first operational unit to use the GBU-53/B StormBreaker glide bomb, known as StormBreaker, at the Utah Test and Training Range, according to a press release from Air Combat Command released on 13 December.\nFour F-15Es from the 366th Fighter Wing had the opportunity to employ this new capability as part of WSEP (Weapon System Evaluation Program).\n- ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW -\nThe evaluation involved multiple aircraft targeting and engaging four ground-based vehicles with four StormBreakers. Despite all of the vehicles being moving targets and this being a relatively new munition, all four were successfully hit.\nThe StormBreaker measures at 69 inches long, 6-7 inches in diameter, weighs 204 pounds and carries a 105 pound warhead. By using a combination of millimeter wave active radar homing, semi-active laser guidance, infrared homing, GPS coupled inertial guidance and data-link, the bomb is proven to strike stationary targets at 69 miles and moving targets at 45 miles.\nAccording to Capt. Kyle “Scrap” Holifield, 391st Fighter Squadron, Chief of Weapons and Tactics, the integrated connectivity of the new bomb is one of its greatest assets, allowing it to be launched and then, if needed, redirected by the aircrew toward a new target while in transit. “I love that it can get on link,” he said referring to the communication system that is used by the F-15E’s, and numerous other platform’s, electronic systems and is the backbone of this capability.\n“The new small diameter bomb provides F-15E’s with new and complimentary capabilities,” said Holifield. “It is not a replacement for other bombs.”\nBecause of the small size of these new munitions, the F-15E Strike Eagle can carry up to 28 GBU-53/Bs. The ability to carry more munitions is critical in situations where there exists a high number of ground targets that require a high level of accuracy as offered by the StormBreaker.\nHowever, there was additional coordination and planning required to employ the new bomb. Due to increased capabilities of this munition, the bomb and the aircraft are able to communicate with each other, which requires intelligence airmen to load encrypted communication information into the bomb’s computer.\nThe person responsible for overseeing the process was 1st Lt. Estefania Ortiz-Santiago, 391st Fighter Squadron Officer in Charge of Intelligence. She said “the process was more extensive” compared to the bombs that the F-15E traditionally uses and that there was a fair amount of trouble shooting to ensure assets were communicating properly.\nOrtiz-Santiago noted that in the future, she expects the process will become more streamlined and take about the same amount of time to prepare as other bombs currently in use by the F-15E.\nThe GBU-53/B is a great addition to the F-15E platform and improves its lethality even further. “I think it’s going to be great. It will be an awesome weapon,” Holifield said.\n“These tests are critical to paving the way for StormBreaker’s employment by the Combat Air Forces,” said Alison Howlett, program director for StormBreaker at Raytheon Missiles & Defense. “By stress-testing the weapon in an operational environment, we are even more confident in the weapon’s ability to strike targets in difficult conditions.”\nWhile the GBU-53/B is currently only approved for integration on the Strike Eagle, results will also support the employment of StormBreaker by joint capabilities with the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and eventually fifth generation platforms such as the F-35.\n“StormBreaker employment is a team effort. It requires the expertise of our aircrew, intelligence, munitions and maintenance Airmen to ensure we’re implementing the most effective processes efficiently,” said Col Ernesto DiVittorio, the 366th Fighter Wing Commander. “Gunfighters have always been on the leading edge of innovation. I knew the F-15E and the 366th Fighter Wing were the right front line team to first evaluate the integration of the GBU-53/B. This new capability will start by increasing our lethality in today’s fights, but has applicability if the United States must fight on future battlefields.”\n",

        "原文": "byLos Alamos National Laboratory\nReactor Operator Nicholas Thompson of Los Alamos National Laboratory helps to set up the neutron clustering measurements at the Walthousen Reactor Critical Facility at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Schenectady, NY. Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory\nFor the first time, the long-theorized neutron-clustering effect in nuclear reactors has been demonstrated, which could improve reactor safety and create more accurate simulations, according to a new study recently published in the journalNature Communications Physics.\n\"The neutron-clustering phenomenon had been theorized for years, but it had never been analyzed in a workingreactor,\" said Nicholas Thompson, an engineer with the Los Alamos Advanced Nuclear Technology Group. \"The findings indicate that, as neutrons fission and create more neutrons, some go on to form large lineages of clusters while others quickly die off, resulting in so-called 'power tilts,' or asymmetrical energy production.\"\nUnderstanding these clustering fluctuations is especially important for safety and simulation accuracy, particularly as nuclear reactors first begin to power up. The study was a collaboration with the Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) and the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), both located in France.\n\"We were able to model the life of each neutron in thenuclear reactor, basically building a family tree for each,\" said Thompson. \"What we saw is that even if the reactor is perfectly critical, so the number of fissions from one generation to the next is even, there can be bursts of clusters that form and others that quickly die off.\"\nThis clustering phenomenon became important to understand because of astatistical conceptknown as the gambler's ruin, believed to have been derived by Blaise Pascal. In a betting analogy, the concept says that even if the chances of a gambler winning or losing each individual bet are 50 percent, over the course of enough bets the statistical certainty that the gambler will go bankrupt is 100 percent.\nIn nuclear reactors, from generation to generation, each neutron can be said to have a similar 50 percent chance of dying or fissioning to create more neutrons. According to the gambler's ruin concept, the neutrons in a reactor might then have a statistical chance of dying off completely at some future generation, even though the system is at critical.\nThis concept had been studied widely in other scientific fields, such as biology and epidemiology, where this generational clustering phenomenon is also present. By drawing on this related statistical math, the research team was able to analyze whether the gambler's ruin concept would hold true for neutrons in nuclear reactors.\n\"You would expect this theory to hold true,\" says Jesson Hutchinson, who works with the Laboratory's Advanced Nuclear Technology Group. \"You should have a critical system that, while the neutron population is varying between generations, runs some chance of becoming subcritical and losing all neutrons. But that's not what happens.\"\nTo understand why the gambler's ruin concept didn't hold true, researchers used a low-power nuclear reactor located at the Walthousen Reactor Critical Facility in New York. A low-power reactor was essential for tracking the lifespans of individual neutrons because large-scale reactors can have trillions of interactions at any moment. The team used three different neutron detectors, including the Los Alamos-developed Neutron Multiplicity 3He Array Detector (NoMAD), to trace every interaction inside the reactor.\nThe team found that while generations of neutrons would cluster in large family trees and others died out, a complete die-off was avoided in the small reactor because of spontaneous fission, or the non-induced nuclear splitting of radioactive material inside reactors, which creates more neutrons. That balance of fission andspontaneous fissionprevented the neutron population from dying out completely, and it also tended to smooth out the energy bursts created by clustering neutrons.\n\"Commercial-sized nuclear reactors don't depend on the neutron population alone to reach criticality, because they have other interventions like temperature and control rod settings,\" Hutchinson said. \"But this test was interested in answering fundamental questions aboutneutronbehavior in reactors, and the results will have an impact on the math we use to simulate reactors and could even affect future design and safety procedures.\"\n",

        "原文": "MONDAY, JANUARY 16, 2023 BY INDIAN DEFENCE NEWS\nIndia and Japan were set to kick off their first-ever joint fighter aircraft exercise on Monday as the two strategic partners continue to deepen defence and security ties amid growing concerns over China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.\nNamed Veer Guardian-23, the aerial manoeuvres were to take place in the airspace around the Air Self-Defence Force’s Hyakuri and Iruma air bases in Ibaraki Prefecture, running until Jan. 26.\nThe ASDF said in a statement that the purpose of the exercises is to “promote mutual understanding, strengthen defence cooperation between the air forces” and enhance the ASDF’s tactical skills.\nThe Indian Ministry of Defence said the 11-day exercise, which will include training for various “air combat missions in a complex environment,” will also fortify the “long-standing bond of friendship” and pave the way for greater interoperability between the two air forces.\nThe Indian contingent includes four Su-30MKI multirole fighters, two C-17 Globemaster transport planes, one IL-78 aerial tanker and about 150 personnel, while the ASDF will field four F-2s and an equal number of F-15 multirole fighters.\nWith the launch of the exercise series, India has now become the fifth country to send fighter jets to Japan for joint drills following the United States, Australia, Britain and Germany, as Tokyo expands its array of security partners across the globe.\nNew Delhi-based defense analyst Rahul Bedi said the joint training could help the ASDF “draw lessons from the extensive operational experience of the Indian Air Force,” particularly with regards to China, and the technical innovations it has achieved on its fighters, especially the Sukhoi-30MKI fighters taking part in the exercise.\nThe launch of Veer Guardian-23 was agreed upon during a “two-plus-two” meeting in September between the nations’ foreign and defense ministers that also saw the two countries announce the launch of high-level talks between the Japan Joint Staff and the Indian Integrated Defence Staff. The two sides also pledged to conduct “more complex and sophisticated” exercises and boost multilateral maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean region.\nJapan and India, which are members of “the Quad” grouping of nations alongside the United States and Australia, are not only enhancing their own defense capabilities but have also been deepening security cooperation in recent years. Tokyo and New Delhi are also considering expanding their partnership to include defense equipment and technological cooperation.\nBedi said that India, which relies heavily on Russian-made equipment for its military, is seeking defense-industrial collaboration with technologically advanced countries to help reduce materiel imports.\nOne of the key factors driving the partnership is the shared concern over the impact of China’s rise in the region. Apart from their respective territorial disputes with Beijing, India and Japan are also increasingly worried about China’s economic and political influence, not least via Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative and its growing maritime assertiveness.\nIn 2008, Tokyo and New Delhi signed a joint declaration on security cooperation to enhance information exchanges and policy coordination. In September 2020, they reached an agreement to facilitate the reciprocal provision of supplies and services between the Self-Defense Forces and the Indian military.\nAs part of the Quad, the two countries participate regularly in the Malabar naval exercise series. They also conduct bilateral naval drills, including JIMEX-22, which was hosted by the Indian Navy in the Bay of Bengal last September. Moreover, they hold bilateral ground exercises such as Dharma Guardian, the latest iteration of which took place last February and March in Belgaum, southwestern India.\n“The continuing sophistication of India-Japan military exercises represents a natural development and growing comfort between the two countries,” said Dhruva Jaishankar, an expert on Indian foreign policy and executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America.\n“Ties have grown gradually since the year 2000, but the recent establishment of regular air and ground exercises — after many years of primarily maritime cooperation — represents a qualitatively different stage in the relationship,” he added.\nThat said, there is still room for improvement from both sides, analysts say, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposing the differences in Tokyo and New Delhi’s responses to the crisis.\n“Relations, including security relations, have grown quite impressively, but I worry that we are also at something of a plateau,” Jaishankar said.\n“A lot will depend on Japan’s ability to see through expectations on defence spending and military modernization, and on India’s part, its ability to project power in traditional and new domains,” he added.\n",

        "原文": "AUSA 2022—Artificial intelligence analytics company BigBear.ai is developing an “intelligent automation platform” for the Army that a company executive says will streamline over a dozen outdated data systems into one solution, getting rid of manual processes as the service moves toward becoming more data-driven.\nThe company announced on Sept. 29 it had won a contract valued at $14.8 million for the Army Global Force Information Management System (GFIM), a cloud platform meant to provide a “holistic view” of the service’s data to make risk-informed decisions through an automated process.\n“What that means is it’s going to empower senior leaders and the combatant commanders to do things like manning, equipping, training, resourcing the force more effectively,” Ryan Legge, president of BigBear.ai’s analytics sector, told Breaking Defense Wednesday. “It’s going to be a large-scale effort. So the end state solution is going to transition away from 14 legacy systems that the Army is using right now.”\nLegge said the streamlining of the 14 legacy systems into one will provide real-time data for up to 160,000 users across the Army. The application won’t just be taking feeds of data from other systems, but will create and aggregate data, he said. \nThe company will use a combination of Appian, a business process management tool, and some of Palantir’s data and cloud hosting technologies to create the application. \nThe company’s work on GFIM will be a step in helping the service meet one of Army Secretary Christine Wormuth’s top objectives: ensuring the service evolves into a data-centric and data-driven one. It will also “sit on the edges” of the service’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) efforts, although it’s not directly tied to it, Legge said. \n“I wouldn’t say it’s directly related to JADC2 but a lot of what is done during these [enterprise-to-tactical] processes is going to be a part of the mission focus of what JADC2 delivers as a mission application,” he said. “It will definitely touch on a lot of those pieces when you’re looking at readiness to the force, training the force, equipping the force, manning the force. A lot of those sit on the peripheral of JADC2, which is going to feed that higher vision of what they’re looking to do with that solution.” \nBigBear.ai is currently delivering three capabilities — an analytical tool, a force projection tool and a data layer — and building on its previous work with the GFIM. The company previously won a contract last November for the first phase of the project, during which the company delivered a prototype of the solution to the service. Phase two of GFIM will be broken into two different parts, Legge said. \n“The first part of this phase we are under right now is going to be to…develop the future force capability to what they call a minimum viable product,” Legge said. “So an MVP. So it’s going to be getting this to almost a production-ready application.

        "原文": "ByColin?DemarestandStephen?Losey\nJun24, 09:22PM\nA U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry assigned to the 964th Airborne Air Control Squadron, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, sits on the ramp at Tyndall AFB, Florida, during Checkered Flag 22-1. (Airman 1st Class Tiffany Price/U.S. Air Force)\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force launched a program it says will sharpen its command and control and battle management abilities as it prepares for potential war against a major adversary.\nThe weapons system evaluation program, dubbedCombat Axe, is designed give leaders a look at how the Air Force’s command and control systems perform against technologically savvy opponents and real-world threats, including contested or degraded communications and radar.\nThis scenario is becoming increasingly important as the U.S. military pivots away from counterinsurgency and smaller-scale operations toward preparations for a larger fight against a world power, such as China or Russia.\nTheAir Forcerolled out the predecessor to Combat Axe, then known as Combat Sentry, in July 2020.\nCombat Axe training and analysis was conducted during the Combat Archer 22.08 and Checkered Flag 22-2 exercises, among the largest combined air-to-air tests in the U.S. Squadrons from the Air Force, Navy and Royal Australian Air Force participated.\nPublishedJune 22, 2022\nBy 1st Lt Lindsey Heflin\n53rd Wing\nEglin Air Force Base, Fla. -- In an effort to align with the Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr.’sAccelerate Change or Losestrategic approach, the 53rd Wing has developed a new branch of the Weapons System Evaluation Program focusing solely on Battle Management Command and Control. The new WSEP branch is known as COMBAT AXE. The primary objective of the program is to present high-end scenarios and collect and analyze data in order to arm Senior Leaders, Combatant Commanders, and operators with an enhanced understanding of the performance of the Air Force’s C2 weapon systems against maturing threats. The COMBAT AXE program excels at this objective while simultaneously providing advanced training experiences for combat-ready operators. Originally dubbed COMBAT SENTRY during the initial evolution from vision to reality, the program has since been rebranded COMBAT AXE to align with the Air Force’s evolution of the Theater Air Control System (TACS) to the emerging Air Component Control System (ACCS) concept that will provide light, agile,distributed tactical command and control capabilities. “In order to be successful, we realized we had to field the program in a cost-effective manner. So, we got innovative and took advantage of the 53rd Wing’s specialized resources,” said Lt. Col. Steve Wyatt, 81st Air Control Squadron commander. “These resources included access to the many test and training events held in the Gulf Range, access to 53rd Wing aerial targets, and the acquisition of Squadron Innovation Funds coupled with a partnership with the 53rd Test Support Squadron to build high-end threat simulators that can target C2 systems.” Recently, the 81st ACS conducted COMBAT AXE during the combined COMBAT ARCHER 22.08 and CHECKERED FLAG 22-2 exercises. This was one of the largest combined air-to-air test, evaluation, and training exercises to take place in the United States. The May 2022 event was hosted at Tyndall AFB, Fla., where squadrons from the United States Air Force, United States Navy, and Royal Australian Air Force conducted both large force employment scenarios and air-to-air live-fire weapons employment. During the event, the 81st ACS, E-2C, E-3G and E-7A crews integrated C2 tactics in an environment that replicated operationally relevant challenges the weapon systems would face. This involved the incorporation of various unique sensors from each weapon system and the integration of data links and communication tactics to create a common operational picture across the C2 architecture. Ultimately this enabled C2 crews to identify threats with increased speed, precision, and confidence and share these threats with participating fighter aircraft. “Not only is this type of joint training critical to countering strategic competitors, it also provides us the opportunity to collect data to help understand how to modernize our weapon systems, tactics, and training” said Wyatt. “In order to fight as a Joint and Coalition forces, we need to understand each other's capabilities and limitations, and how each entity operates and communicates.” COMBAT AXE is one of six major elements of the USAF’s Combat Weapons System Evaluation Program. WSEP is charged with evaluating full-spectrum combat capability to ensure air superiority versus the near-peer adversary. \n---\nFor more information, contact 1st Lt Lindsey Heflin, Public Affairs Advisor for the 53rd Wing at 850-598-3283 or lindsey.heflin.1@us.af.mil.

        "原文": "The past month has yielded several announcements from the copper 3D printing sector.\nInfinite Flex, a Germany-based developer of smart materials, recently launched what it claims to be the world’s first pure copper powder for SLM 3D printing. Dubbed INFINITE POWDER Cu 01, the material has already been successfully tested on a number of standard SLM 3D printers such as the EOS M290 and Trumpf TruPrint 1000, and is now commercially available.\nElsewhere, UK-based alloy design firm Alloyed recently showcased its latest copper 3D printing application – a highly optimized cooling plate for use in high-performance temperature regulation applications.\nMichael Holmes, MD at Alloyed, said, “The cooling plate is a great example of what can be done when optimized AM geometry is combined with optimized AM material properties.”\nInfinite Flex’s INFINITE POWDER Cu 01\nPure copper is well known for its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, making it the universal material of choice for wiring and heat transfer components such as heat exchangers, piping, and heat sinks. Unfortunately, pure copper is also extremely difficult to process using laser-based 3D printing systems due to both its conductivity and high reflectivity, which renders high-power laser beams useless.\nTo address this, materials companies have developed a number of copper alloys such as CuCrZr or CuNiSiCr, but these alloys often offer significantly poorer conductivity characteristics than their pure counterpart. Infinite Flex states that, as a result, 3D printed copper parts so far simply haven’t been able to deliver the properties of traditionally manufactured copper.\nThe firm believes the answer to the problem lies in its new INFINITE POWDER Cu 01 material, a new pure copper powder designed specifically for SLM 3D printers. The powder offers a tensile strength of over 220MPa, an elongation of 24%, and results in high-density parts (>99.9%). Infinite Flex believes its latest launch will enable a new wave of high-performance 3D printing applications such as heat exchangers, induction coils, and electronics components.\nAlloyed’s 3D printed copper cooling plate\nAlloyed’s 3D printed copper cooling plate is designed for use in high-temperature computing systems such as data centers and in general liquid cooling systems. The part features a 3D printing-enabled lattice geometry that combines functionality and performance, all while minimizing material usage.\nAdditionally, the monolithic nature of the printed cooling plate means it’s both simpler and more efficient at transferring heat than traditionally assembled cold plates. In fact, since it doesn’t need to be assembled at all, it proved easier to install and benefits from lower maintenance requirements. The result is greater performance when it comes to reducing energy usage when compared to conventional air cooling methods.\nTo enable the project, Alloyed partnered with JX Nippon Mining & Metals (JXNMM), a specialist in copper powder development. JXNMM has a history of developing copper powders with improved 3D printability, which is does via a novel surface treatment process that prevents an increase in oxygen content in the powder. In the context of laser-based 3D printing systems, this means an increase in absorptivity, which leads to improved printability.\nEnrique Alabort, co-founder of Alloyed and Head of Alloyed Japan, explains, “The success of the copper cooling plate is due to the combined expertise of Alloyed and JXNMM. The materials developed by JX allow Alloyed to use its proprietary Engine? and Architect? software to produce the high-fidelity complex geometries and lattice structures in the cooling plate.”\nIn other copper news, binder jet 3D printer manufacturer ExOne recently teamed up with Tennessee-based start-up Maxxwell Motors to develop a unique 3D printed copper e-winding design for the latter’s axial flux electric motors.\nElsewhere, Sintavia, an additive manufacturing service provider for the aerospace sector, has previously developed a proprietary 3D printing process for copper alloy. Developed specifically for GRCop-42, a NASA-developed copper alloy created for the 3D printing of rocket propulsion components, the technology includes both a proprietary set of 3D printing parameters and a novel heat treatment post-processing step.\nLast year, industrial 3D printer manufacturer Digital Metal also announced the launch of its own pure copper powder, DM Cu, for use with its binder jet 3D printing technology.\n",

Compared with the traditional air cooling method, it has more obvious advantages in saving energy.To implement the project, Alloyed partnered with copper powder development specialist JX Nippon Mining & Metals (JXNMM). JXNMM has experience in developing 3D printing copper powder, which is a new surface treatment process to prevent the increase of oxygen content in powder. Under the background of laser 3D printing system, this means that the absorption rate is improved, and the printability is also improved.According to the person in charge of Alloyed, the successful research and development of copper heat dissipation plate is mainly attributed to the deep experience of Alloyed and JXNMM in this field. Materials developed by JX enable Alloyed to use its proprietary Engine? And Architect? Software to generate high-fidelity complex geometry and lattice structure in heat dissipation plate.It is reported that ExOne, a manufacturer of adhesive jet 3D printer, recently cooperated with Maxxwell Motors, a start-up company in Tennessee, USA, to develop a unique 3D printing copper electronic winding design for the latter's axial flux motor. In addition, Sintavia, an additive manufacturing service provider in the aerospace field, has previously developed a special copper alloy 3D printing process. This technology is specially developed for GRCop-42, which is a copper alloy developed by NASA for 3D printing of rocket propulsion components. This technology includes a set of proprietary 3D printing parameters and a new heat treatment system.In addition, Digital Metal, an industrial 3D printer manufacturer, also announced the launch of pure copper powder DM Cu products for adhesive jet 3D printing technology."

        "原文": "ByJason Sherman\nJanuary 25, 2022 at 2:24 PM\nThe Defense Department is looking to the video game industry to help improve a high-consequence system used by U.S. military forces to determine where best to position guided missile interceptors and radars to defeat long-range missile threats, including North Korean nuclear-armed rockets.\nThe Missile Defense Agency is looking to companies that deliver content for devices such as Microsoft'sXBox, Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch to help improve the next iteration of the Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications system (C2BMC), in hopes of bringing the design elegance and sophistication of games to war planning.\n“There havebeen such strides in the gaming industry that we want to see if there is something out there we should be bringing in with regards to the user interface,” John Bier, MDA C2BMC Program Director, toldInside Defense.\nC2BMC is a global system of workstations, servers, and network equipment as well as software that effectively stitch together all elements of the Ballistic Missile Defense System -- which MDA is attempting to rebrand the Missile Defense System -- allowing operators to plan activities, see an attack against the United States unfold and manage radars. MDA describes C2BMC as the “all-domain backbone that enables detect, control, engage sequence.”\nSpecifically, MDA is looking to the video gaming industry for help with one of six functional C2BMC capabilities -- the planner.\nThe C2BMC Planner allows the users -- U.S. European, Central, Indo-Pacific and Northern commands -- to collaboratively plan, coordinate and optimize missile defense assets that are in high demand and of which there are relatively few.\nThe tool provides collaborative planning and defense design development capabilities across all levels of command -- strategic, operational and tactical.\nWhile the current C2BMC planner version -- fielded in 2017 and 2018 -- is a powerful tool for gaming out how to defend U.S. territory and interests around the world against the most advanced ballistic missile threats, it is not an intuitive instrument.\n“The current planner today requires training in continual use to be able to operate it,” Bier said. “If you walk away and don’t use it, you’re going to forget how to use it.”\nLast fall, MDA posted a solicitation asking industry for help with a new C2BMC Planner as part of a planned upgrade to Increment 10, slated to begin as soon as Oct. 1 with fielding targeted for 2027.\n“Certainly, gaming is an industry that is pushing the limits of what people can do but the stakes are very low,” said Carol Smith, senior research scientist in human-machine interaction at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute’s artificial intelligence division. “So I'm always very cautious when people talk about learning from gaming patterns and those types of behaviors because we do not want our warfighters comparing their work to a game -- that's not appropriate and is potentially problematic,” she said.\n“So, we definitely want to make sure that their heads are in the right place and that they understand the ramifications of their decisions at a very serious way,” Smith said in an interview. “And so balancing that with also using some of the game mechanics that are really good practices in design, using the best practices across [user interface] design in general is very important.”\nMDA is looking to make it easier for C2BMC operators to manipulate the planning tool.\n“We want to take advantage of the latest designs out there in symbologies and user interface with regard to the planner,” said Bier. “We’re just trying to see -- is there something else there that we should be looking for as we go into building our future C2BMC systems.”\nAny future capability will have to be compatible with existing C2BMC mission suites, he said.\nThe C2BMC planning tool provides a context for commanders to determine how to make the best use of the available missile defense resources.\nThe tool is used -- like a game -- to notionally plot the location of adversary missions and in response, to position available friendly sensors and guided missile interceptors.\nOnce all pieces are in place, the C2BMC planner allows combatant commands to run a simulation and assess how well the defensive plan worked.\nSome pieces are fixed locations -- such as major radar sites in Alaska, Massachusetts, Greenland and the United Kingdom as well as silos for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system – while others are mobile, including ballistic missile defense capable Aegis ships, the SBX-Radar as well as Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense batteries.\nA combatant command uses the C2BMC Planner to put together a regional missile defense architecture and then simulate a ballistic missile attack and defense against the strike.\n“Planners will then do a gap analysis and decide, ‘Well, I need to move a ship over here, for additional coverage, deploy another forward based radar, to another THAAD battery for regional defense,’” Bier said.\nThese plans eventually translate into the operational environment when a combatant commander is allocated an actual collection of missile defense capabilities. The C2BMC Planner is used to position all elements and then initialize an operational capability across all the component mission suites -- integrating the elements into a cohesive system.\nLockheed Martin, prime contractor for C2BMC since 2012, is supported by Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon Technologies and General Dynamics.\nWhile the current C2BMC Planner is powerful, it is clunky to use relative to the advanced user interfaces available today, he said.\nBier likened the current C2BMC Planner to programming a video cassette recorder. The VCR ushered in a revolutionary capability: to record broadcast television. The process for programming the VCR to schedule a recording was intensive compared to today’s experiences with sophisticated technology interfaces.\n“We want to make it easier so that you can sit down at a workstation and select the items to put out there in the [area of responsibility] that you’re trying to design the plan for -- modify things you want each of those elements to do,” Bier said. “Then run it and see what the results are. We want that simplicity.”\nHe said it is very time consuming to continuously train personnel to work the C2BMC planner.\n“If you could, in a virtual world, just grab assets and move them quickly around the globe versus having to type in latitude and longitude coordinates,” that would be a big improvement, he said.\nUsing a drag-and-drop or a comparable means to shift the angle of a radar -- say 5 or 10 degrees, a user can more quickly design a plan that is optimized for changing variables. In addition, this speed and ease could allow for development of additional contingency plans, he said.\n“So as the real fight starts, if you need to change plans -- maybe more reds out there, less reds out there, the blue assets are up and down . . . based on their current status -- you want to be able to have a flexible plan that can be re-initialized into the weapon system,” he said.\nMDA spends more than $500 million annually on C2BMC which provides persistent acquisition, tracking, cueing, discrimination, and fire-control quality data to the Aegis ballistic missile defense system, the GMD, THAAD and Patriot systems as well as coalition partners -- in support of both homeland and regional defense.\nThe current spiral, 8.2-3, was fielded in 2019 and included upgrades to support the European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 3, specifically a new capability called Engage on Remote that integrates Aegis BMD with forward-based radars, including the THAAD AN/TPY-2 radar -- to allow operators to track, acquire and intercept incoming ballistic missiles sooner.\nIn FY-22, MDA plans a new upgrade, 8.2-5, to incorporate command and control for homeland defense using the new Long Range Discrimination Radar that was delivered for testing last month. After that, MDA is in early development, contemplating Spiral 8.2-7 for delivery in FY-24 with a System Track for Homeland Defense that aims to improve discrimination for GMD engagements and tracking of additional threats such as maneuvering hypersonic weapons.\n",

C2BMC planning tool provides collaborative planning and defense design and improvement capabilities across strategic, operational and tactical commands, and allows the European Command, Central Command, Indo-Pacific Command and Northern Command of the United States to coordinate and optimize operational plans under the conditions of small number of missile defense assets and large demand. The current planning tool was put into use in 2017 and 2018, but it is not intuitive and needs continuous training for operators. In the autumn of 2021, MDA released a prospectus seeking help from the industrial sector, requesting the provision of a new C2BMC planning tool, which is planned to be deployed in 2027.The use of planning tools is similar to that of games. In theory, planning tools indicate the location of enemy missiles, and available friendly detectors and interceptors. After all combat units are in place, the combat command uses planning tools to simulate the combat plan and evaluate its effectiveness, and then modifies the plan according to the analysis results. When the actual missile defense equipment is assigned to the commander, the scheme is transformed into the combat environment, and the planning tool locates all the combat units, and starts the initialization of combat capability, that is, integrates each combat unit into one system.MDA staff said, \"If you can get resources in the virtual world and move them quickly instead of entering latitude and longitude coordinates.\" Using drag-and-drop or similar methods to change the angle of radar, users can design optimized solutions more quickly. When the actual battle begins, the battle plan can be modified according to the actual situation and reinitialized into the weapon system.Active C2BMC System 8. Versions 2-3 began to be deployed in 2019 to support \"European Stage Adaptive Stage 3\", integrating Aegis system with radar to obtain \"long-range engagement\" capability. MDA plans to upgrade to 8 in fiscal year 2022. Version 2-5 integrates the new long-range identification radar (LRDR) into the local defense finger control system. MDA plans to deliver 8. 8% in fiscal year 2024. Version 2-7, equipped with a local defense tracking system, aims to improve the identification ability of ground-based midcourse defense engagement and the tracking ability against other threats such as hypersonic weapons."

MDA did not seek funding for these in FY-22.\nIn April 2019, Mike Griffin -- then the Pentagon's top weapons technology official -- directed MDA to scrap plans for mounting a directed-energy system on an aircraft, effectively terminating the Low Power Laser Demonstrator project that aimed to flesh out a design for an entire airborne system. It was subsequently restructured in 2019 to focus only on the laser as part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense-led Laser Scaling Initiative.\nThat move two years ago also brough an end to MDA's sponsorship of a development effort on a Diode Pumped Alkali Laser System with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, CA. The proposed legislation would authorize work on that project to be reinstated.\nIn February, MDA leaned out ahead of the proposed congressional authorization when it asked industry for ideas on a new laser project to advance technology able to destroy ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missile threats in all phases of flight.\nSpecifically, MDA published a notice asking industry for ideas on pulsed laser prototype weapon systems as part of an effort to inform future missile defense architectures.

Phillips Federal and the US Army will use the WarpSPEE3D to further develop the facility’s Additive Manufacturing capability, and develop large format, parts-on-demand metal applications for the US Army.\nJohn Harrison, Global Director of Phillips Additive, states, “Since 2020, the unique high-speed capabilities of SPEE3D technology have proven to be an excellent addition in supporting the RIA’s manufacturing innovation objectives, and the scope of our P3 Program. The new WarpSPEE3D printer at the RIA’s Center of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing facility will allow us to further our scope and make cutting-edge achievements in developing large-format applications for expeditionary forces in the US”.\nPhillips Corporation, Federal Division, is the leading service provider and manufacturing partner to the United States Federal Government. Phillips Federal first added the metal Additive Manufacturing technologies of SPEE3D to support its Public Private Partnership (P3) and Additive Manufacturing programs at the US Army’s Rock Island Arsenal (RIA) in 2020.\nIn 2022, SPEE3D’s WarpSPEE3D technology will be added to the Center of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing to support activities in material exploration and research, and the development and manufacture of future large-format applications and prototypes for the Army et al Armed Forces.\nBruce Colter, SPEE3D’s Vice President & General Manager of North America added, “We expect the delivery of this new WarpSPEE3D printer to provide Phillips Federal & the Rock Island Arsenal with additional capabilities from our patented Cold Spray AM technology, the fastest metal 3D printing capability in the world. WarpSPEE3D printers have demonstrated in field trials that they can make high-quality metal parts on-demand which are critical to keep military equipment & vehicles operational. The American AM space is growing rapidly, and SPEE3D’s technology is only growing with it”.\nSince 2020, the WarpSPEE3D has been used often by Defense forces for an on-demand, deployable metal manufacturing capability. In 2020 and 2021, the Australian Army conducted several field trials with their WarpSPEE3D tactical printer at Mount Bundey, and Bradshaw Training Area during Exercise Koolendong. The field trials in 2020 resulted in over fifty case studies of printable parts and demonstrated that SPEE3D’s WarpSPEE3D printer was robust enough to operate in remote Australian bushland. In 2021, the program was extended to verify initial results, along with the establishment of new field trials and the Australian Army’s Additive Manufacturing Cell (AMC) technicians. In the 2021 field trials, the Australian Army successfully proved it is possible to 3D print, certify, validate, and replace armored vehicle parts in the field. The success of these trials demonstrated that additive manufacturing could play an important part in the future of Defense readiness.\n“We believe this expansion is an exciting opportunity for SPEE3D and the DoD forces. Our smaller LightSPEE3D system has been used as part of the RIA program with great success. With a WarpSPEE3D, Phillips Federal & the Rock Island Arsenal will be able to explore a wider range of large, high quality, low-cost metal parts manufactured quickly,” says Byron Kennedy, CEO of SPEE3D.\n",

        "原文": "Scientists from DTU have shown that a Fano laser, a new type of microscopic laser, has fundamental advantages compared to other types of lasers. The discovery can be important for many future applications, such as integrated photonics, interfacing of electronics and photonics, and optical sensors.\nAn increasing fraction of the global energy consumption is used for information technology, and photonics operating at very high data rates with ultra-low energy per bit has been identified as a key technology to enable sustainable growth of capacity demands.\nHowever, existing laser designs cannot just be scaled down to reach the goals for next-generation integrated devices, and fundamental discoveries in the field of nanophotonics are therefore needed.\nSupported by a Villum Center of Excellence, NATEC, a newly established DNRF Center of Excellence, NanoPhoton, and an ERC Advanced Grant, scientists from DTU are exploring the physics and applications of a new class of photonic devices using a phenomenon known as Fano interference. This physical effect offers an opportunity for realizing ultrafast and low-noise nanolasers (called Fano lasers), optical transistors, and quantum devices working at the level of a single photon.\nNow, the DTU scientists have shown that the coherence of a Fano laser can be significantly improved compared to existing microscopic lasers. The result has been published in Nature Photonics.\n\"The coherence of a laser is a measure of the purity of the color of the light generated by the laser. A higher coherence is essential to numerous applications, such as on-chip communications, programmable photonic integrated circuits, sensing, quantum technology, and neuromorphic computing. For example, coherent optical communication systems transmit and detect information using the phase of light pulses, leading to a tremendous information capacity\" says Jesper M?rk, Professor at DTU Fotonik and Center Leader of NATEC and NanoPhoton.\nJesper M?rk further explains: that \"the Fano laser, with a size of a few microns (one micron is one-thousandth of a millimetre), operates in an unusual optical state, a so-called bound-state-in the-continuum, induced by the Fano resonance. The existence of such a state was first identified by some of the early pioneers of quantum mechanics, but evaded experimental observation for many years. In the paper, we show that the characteristics of such a bound-state-in-the-continuum can be harnessed to improve the coherence of the laser.\"\n\"The observation is somewhat surprising,\" adds lead author and senior researcher at DTU Fotonik, Yi Yu, \"since a bound-state-in-the-continuum is much less robust than the states commonly used in lasers. We show in our paper, experimentally as well as theoretically, that the peculiarities of this new state can be used to advantage.\"\nYi Yu continues that \"to achieve the goal we have developed, in collaboration with Professor Kresten Yvind's group at DTU Fotonik, an advanced nanotechnology platform, called Buried Heterostructure Technology. This technology allows realizing small, nanometer-sized regions of active material, where the light generation takes place, while the remaining laser structure is passive. It is the physics of Fano resonance combined with this technology that eventually enables the suppression of quantum noise, leading to the highest measured coherence for microscopic lasers.\"\nThis new finding may lead to the use of Fano lasers in integrated electronic-photonic circuits, in particular in new generations of high-speed computers. In today's computers, electrical signals are used for logic operations as well as for transmitting data between different parts of the computer. However, due to ohmic losses, a lot of energy is wasted in the transmission. The primary role of the Fano laser will be to convert the electrical data to light signals, which then are transmitted within the computer almost without loss – just as it is done in optical fibres on the internet today. The long-term perspective is to get much faster computer chips with minimal energy consumption.\n",
        "中文原文": "DTU的科学家们已经表明，一种新型的微观激光器--法诺激光器，与其他类型的激光器相比，具有根本的优势。这一发现对许多未来的应用，如集成光子学、电子学和光子学的接口以及光学传感器等都具有重要意义。全球能源消耗中越来越多的部分用于信息技术，以极高的数据速率和超低的每比特能量运行的光子学已被确定为实现容量需求可持续增长的关键技术。然而，现有的激光设计不能只是缩小规模来达到下一代集成器件的目标，因此需要在纳米光子学领域的基本发现。在Villum卓越中心、NATEC、新成立的DNRF卓越中心、纳米光子和ERC高级赠款的支持下，DTU的科学家们正在探索一种新的光子器件的物理和应用，这种器件使用的是一种被称为Fano干涉的现象。这种物理效应为实现超快低噪声纳米激光（称为Fano激光）、光学晶体管和单光子水平上工作的量子器件提供了机会。现在，DTU的科学家已经表明，与现有的显微激光相比，Fano激光的相干性可以显著提高。这一结果已发表在《自然·光子学》上。“激光的相干性是衡量激光产生的光的颜色纯度的尺度。更高的相干性对许多应用至关重要，如片上通信、可编程光子集成电路、传感、量子技术和神经形态计算。例如，相干光通信系统利用光脉冲的相位传输和检测信息，导致巨大的信息容量，”DTU Fotonik教授、NATEC和纳米光子中心负责人Jesper M？rk说。Jesper M？rk进一步解释说：“几微米（一微米是千分之一毫米）大小的Fano激光器工作在一种不寻常的光学状态下，这种状态是由Fano共振引起的，即所谓的连续体中束缚态。这种状态的存在最初是由量子力学的一些早期先驱发现的，但多年来一直回避实验观察。在本文中，我们表明这种连续体中束缚态的特性可以被用来提高激光的相干性。”该研究的主要作者兼DTU Fotonik的高级研究员Yi Yu补充说：“这一观察结果有些令人惊讶，因为连续体中的束缚态比激光中常用的状态要弱得多。我们在论文中从实验和理论上证明，这种新态的特性可以被利用。”Yi Yu继续说，“为了实现这一目标，我们与DTU Fotonik的Kresten Yvind教授团队合作开发了一种先进的纳米技术平台，称为埋藏异质结构技术。这种技术允许实现活性材料的微小纳米尺寸区域，在那里产生光，而剩余的激光结构是被动的。正是法诺共振的物理与这种技术结合，最终实现了量子噪声的抑制，导致微观激光的最高相干性。”这一新发现可能导致Fano激光器在集成电子-光子电路中的应用，特别是在新一代高速计算机中。在今天的计算机中，电信号被用于逻辑运算以及在计算机的不同部分之间传输数据。然而，由于欧姆损耗的存在，在传输过程中浪费了大量的能量。Fano激光器的主要作用是将电数据转换成光信号，然后在计算机中几乎没有损失地传输--就像今天互联网上的光纤一样。长远的观点是以最小的能耗获得速度快得多的计算机芯片。",

This discovery is of great significance to the future development of integrated photonics, electronic and photonics interfaces and optical sensors. In the research, the researchers found that the Fano laser is only a few microns in size, can be caused by Fano resonance, and can work in the bound state in continuous spectrum. The researchers said that this bound state characteristic in continuous medium can be used to improve the coherence of laser. In order to prove the practicability of this new state characteristic, researchers developed a nano-platform using buried heterostructure technology. This technology can accurately control the active material to generate light in a specific micro-and nano-scale space. It is the combination of Fano resonance physics principle and this nano-platform technology that successfully suppresses quantum noise, thus realizing the highest coherence of micro-laser. This research expands the application of Fano laser in the new generation of high-speed computers, makes it possible to obtain faster computer chips with minimum energy consumption, and promotes the innovative development of computer technology."

(Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON ― A senior U.S. State Department official said Thursday that a massive Ukraine aid package ― which contains $4 billion in grants for allies to buy American-made military hardware ― is partly aimed at eroding Russia’s share of the global defense market.\n“There is an opportunity here for us to work on helping other countries divest from Russian equipment moving forward,” Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nThe U.S. should take advantage of the Russian invasion force’s poor performance against western-backed Ukrainian forces and Russia’s faltering defense supply chain, she said, to diminish Moscow’s influence abroad and increase America’s.\n“It gives us an opportunity to also send that message around the world to our partners and allies and friends about Russia’s reliability as a defense partner,” Lewis said, adding: “There are long-term impacts, and frankly opportunities, that we need to seize right now.”\nWashington is fostering three-way swaps, where Eastern European nations send Ukraine their Soviet-era kit in exchange for U.S.-made weapons, that should be used to “encourage partners to diversify their equipment inventories away from Russian systems,” Lewis said. But she also worried China could also have its eyes on Russia’s vulnerable market share.\n“Priority systems for diversification could include, but are not limited to, legacy Russian fixed and rotary-wing aviation, air defense, armor and infantry fighting vehicles, and artillery systems,” she said in written testimony. “It is imperative that we provide affordable or subsidized U.S. solutions, not only to offramp partners from Russia, but also to ensure that any global military capability gaps that emerge are not filled by People’s Republic of China.”\nRussia is the world’s second-largest arms exporter after the U.S., averaging more than $13 billion in reported annual sales, according to the Congressional Research Service. Russia exports a majority of its arms to five states: India ― the largest importer of Russian arms since 2016 ― followed by Algeria, China, Egypt and Vietnam.\nBut U.S.-led sanctions are straining Russia’s defense supply chain, even forcing it to use microchips from household appliances in some military equipment, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told lawmakers this week.\n“We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground, it’s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,” Raimondo told Senate appropriators.\nU.S. exports of technology to Russia have fallen by nearly 70 percent since sanctions were imposed in late February, after Russia invaded Ukraine, she said, adding that two Russian tank factories have shut, along with a number of auto makers.\nAfter $650 million in State Department-controlled Foreign Military Financing was approved for Ukraine and other Eastern and Central European countries in the previous Ukraine-related aid package, the pending $40 billion package would add another $4 billion.\nThe proposed aid was approved overwhelmingly by the House and has strong bipartisan support in the Senate, but it has been delayed until next week by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who often opposes U.S. intervention abroad.\nIn Lewis’ written testimony, she pointed to Russia and China to make a pitch for “broader structural mechanisms [to] make U.S. arms transfers more competitive.” She argued for building defense exportability into platforms and technology early in the acquisition process, as well as flexible financing options for the purchasing country.\nThe panel’s chairman, Sen. Robert Menendez, R-N.J., has said he plans to spearhead legislation with the ranking Republican Sen. Jim Risch, of Idaho, to reform America’s globe-spanning security aid program.\n“As with the future of NATO security cooperation, there may need to be changes to our authorities, and I think it will be vital to ensure that the Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department are on the leading edge of finding those solutions to ensure foreign policy remains in the driving seat of our security cooperation with, and assistance to, Taiwan,” Lewis said.\nFollowing a New York Times report that Washington is urging Taiwan to order mobile, lethal weapons that would help its small military repel a seaborne invasion from China better than large weapons platforms, Lewis said it was important to deepen defense ties “in a manner that is commensurate with the threat we assess from the PRC.”\n“[T]he United States supports and encourages Taiwan with its innovative and asymmetric security posture,” Lewis said. “Since the Biden-Harris Administration took office in January 2021, the State Department has approved several key capabilities to Taiwan, including enhanced air defense systems.”\n",

        "原文": "ORLANDO, Fla. —Facing dynamic and challenging future operating environments, the Marine Corps is betting big on new training technology to better prepare warfighters for the unexpected.\nCol. Luis “Lou” Lara, Marine Corps Systems Command’s program manager for training systems, said the service is employing a live-virtual-constructive paradigm to maximize unit readiness.\nLVC training leverages virtual reality and other computer-generated entities to supplement live training.\nThe command’s No. 1 training priority is its Force-on-Force Training Systems-Next program, Lara toldNational Defenseon the sidelines of the National Training and Simulation Association’s annual Training and Simulation Industry Symposium in Orlando, Florida.\nThe Marine Corps awarded Saab a single award task order contract worth up to $128 million in June to produce the system. The capability will allow Marines to “train in realistic, scenario-based, simulated environments against live, role-playing opponents,” according to the service.\nMarines will be equipped with a harness fitted with sensors and transmitters that link to various weapons systems such as an M4 machine gun, Lara said. The weapons use blank ammunition that, when fired, emit lasers that register when a trainee’s vest is hit. The data gathered during the sessions is recorded and can be played back later to provide Marines with individual and unit performance metrics to determine areas of improvement, according to the service.\nThe system can also be used to train with indirect fire weapons such as grenades and mortar rounds, Lara said.\nThrough its contract, Saab will provide equipment deliveries for individual Marine weapons and vehicles, as well as logistics and maintenance support and training exercise support for all of the Corps’ installations worldwide.\nThe new training system will replace the Instrumentation and Tactical Engagement Simulation System, or ITESS, platform. ITESS was not designed to support large-scale exercises, such as those performed at Marine Air-Ground Task Force Training Command, according to the service.\nMarine Corps Systems Command plans to field the Force-on-Force Training Systems-Next between 2023 and 2026 at bases in California, North Carolina, Hawaii, Virginia, Japan and Guam.\nOver the past year, the command’s range training systems office has also been busy upgrading legacy platforms, said Lt. Col. Jon Mohler, product manager for range training systems at the office of the program manager for training systems.\nSince 2007, the Marine Corps has been utilizing infantry immersion trainers at Camp Pendleton, California, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and Marine Corps Base Hawaii in both indoor and outdoor configurations, Mohler said during the conference.\n“The IITs are large, non-live fire training facilities for hands-on practical applications of ethical decision-making in an immersive, scenario-based environment,” he said.\nMany of the simulations conducted through IIT require the use of role players, he said. To fill that gap, the office is looking to develop an immersive training environment capable of replacing role players in various scenarios.\n“The purpose would be to create high fidelity simulations,” he said. The office is pursuing the effort with the Training and Readiness Accelerator Consortium. A request for solutions was slated to be released this summer. TReX — which is managed by the National Security Technology Accelerator — was created to spur innovation and expedite delivery of modeling, simulation and training-related prototypes.\nMarine Corps Systems Command is also investing in its range training family of systems, Lara told conference attendees. Mohler said that includes upgrading the portfolio of automated scoring systems to provide Marines with target scoring capabilities on ground and air-to-ground targets.\nThis will help Marines train by giving them the ability to “engage holistic targets,” he added.\nMeanwhile, officials are creating a range training systems capability development document, or CDD. The document will include physical targets where Marine Corps ground and aviation units can engage with a vast array of weaponry and platforms, including armored vehicles and fixed-wing aircraft in order to support live training, he said.\nThe command is developing another CDD for its ground training systems family of platforms, he added.\nThe capability development document will outline the common characteristics of the systems’ individual programs which will improve interoperability by requiring the various platforms to adhere to common technical standards and components and draw from a library of common data, Lara said.\nThe service is also revitalizing its Combined Arms Command-and-Control Training Upgrade System, or CACCTUS, said Koren Odermann, future technologies integration officer at Marine Corps Systems Command.\nPreviously, CACCTUS was an upgrade for the service’s combined arms staff trainer and provides command-and-control integration and fire support coordination training for Marine air-ground task force staff up to the Marine expeditionary brigade level. It provides two- and three-dimensional visualization of the battlespace.\nThe command is slated to release a request for proposals for CACCTUS post-deployment software support in the September to October timeframe, Odermann said. A contract award is expected to be issued in February 2022.\nThe first year will include option periods starting in April 2022, with four-year options, Odermann said. Total funding is estimated to be about $13 million.\nThe command’s Training Systems Sustainment and Support Services, or TS4, also has a number of initiatives currently in the works as it looks to take advantage of new technology, said Elizabeth Shirley, product manager for synthetic training systems. One ongoing effort is for equipment-related services systems, or ERSS, she said.\nThe effort is a 10-year multiple award task order contract worth up to $249 million that was recently awarded to Hatalom Corp., an Orlando-based defense contractor, she said.\nAnother initiative is related to electronics and communication services known as ECS.\nA request for proposals was released this summer for the effort which will include a 10-year multiple award task order contract with a ceiling of $238 million, she said.\n“The focus here is on software support,” including post deployment sustainment and support, cybersecurity and software development initiatives, she said. As of press time, the contract had not yet been awarded but was expected to be issued in the near future.\nMeanwhile, as the service invests in new training capabilities, it is divesting legacy systems in order to free up money in its budget and reallocate existing funding to new capabilities, Lara said.\n“Over the last year, the Marine Corps has made some significant decisions to reduce or remove costs where systems are no longer effective and won’t meet changing training needs,” he said. Training and Education Command has reduced the number of deployable virtual training systems by more than half, from 676 suites to 333, he noted.\nThe service is not planning to ask for additional funding across its new training initiatives unless it has to, Lara said.\n“We’re getting rid of things that are obviously not in our mission set,” he said.\nThe service is also taking a hard look at usage rates.\n“You have training systems out there, but sometimes unit commanders don’t utilize them, so if they’re not being utilized and they’re not being deployed, why are we maintaining them?” he asked. “We’re divesting of those things.”\nEducation and training is among the top priorities of Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger as the service works to modernize its capabilities and improve readiness.\nBerger “recognized a major factor prohibiting the Marine Corps from achieving his vision [was] outdated operational ranges and training areas that support training requirements,” Lara said.\nNew technologies and innovative approaches are needed to meet the service’s training needs, he said. Platforms that were relevant a decade ago may no longer be so. The service needs industry to freshen its training system tech, he added.\n“By adopting new technologies in combination with new processes and approaches to problem solving, the Marine Corps — with the help of our industry partners — will accelerate its progress towards fielding an important new capability,” he said.\nRecent reductions in legacy combat equipment have led to the cancellation of some training systems, he noted. For example, the divestment of tank units will lead to the end of the service’s M1A1 armored training system and the amphibious assault vehicle armored gunnery training system in fiscal year 2022.\nAdditionally, the indoor simulated marksmanship trainer inventory was reduced by 57 percent, from 485 systems to 206, Lara said.\nThat reduction will “allow for the development of a new capability — the advanced small arms lethality trainer — [which] is a requirements document that we’re currently working with our requirements sponsor on finalizing,” he said.\nThe service plans to field five systems initially as proof of concept.\n",

        "英文整编": "Facing the challenging future combat environment, the US Marine Corps is developing new training technologies by using the Real Installation-Virtual-Construction (LVC) method, so as to maximize the combat readiness of troops and enable combatants to better cope with future challenges. Installation-virtual-construction technology uses virtual reality and other computer-generated entities to enhance outfield training.Develop \"Next Generation Force Confrontation Training System\": The highest priority training program of Marine Corps Command is \"Force-on-Force Confrontation Training Systems-Next Program\". In June 2021, the Marine Corps awarded Saab a copy worth up to 1. The $2.8 billion contract is used to produce the \"next generation force confrontation training system\". The system will allow Marines to \"train against real, role-playing adversaries in a real, scene-based simulation environment.\" Marine Corps combatants will be equipped with straps equipped with sensors and launchers that are connected to various weapon systems, such as M4 machine guns. These weapons use blank ammunition, which emits a laser when fired, and records when the trainee's vest is hit. After the data collected during the training period is recorded, it can also be played back to provide the Marine Corps with individual soldiers and troops training results, so as to identify areas for improvement. The system can also be used to train indirect fire weapons such as grenades and mortars.According to the contract, Saab will provide training equipment for individual weapons and vehicles, as well as logistics and support services, and provide training exercise support for all Marine Corps facilities around the world. The new training system will replace the existing Instrumentation and Tactical Engagement Simulation System (ITESS), because ITESS system is not designed to support large-scale exercises, such as those conducted by the Marine Corps Air Task Force Training Command. The US Marine Corps Systems Command plans to deploy the \"next generation force confrontation training system\" at bases in California, North Carolina, Hawaii, Virginia, Japan and Guam from 2023 to 2026.Developing Infantry Immersion Trainers: Over the past year, the Marine Corps Command's Range Training Systems Office has been upgrading older training platforms. Since 2007, Marines have used infantry immersion trainers (IIT) for indoor and outdoor training at Camp Pendleton, California, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and Marine Corps bases in Hawaii. Infantry immersion trainer is a large-scale non-live-fire shooting training facility, which is used to carry out training in immersive and scene-based environment. Many simulations through infantry immersion trainers require the use of role players. In order to fill this gap, the Range Training System Office is seeking to develop an immersive training environment that can replace role players in various scenes, with the aim of creating a high-fidelity simulation environment.The Range Training Systems Office is also working with the Training and Combat Readiness Accelerator Alliance to develop new solutions. The TReX project currently managed by the National Security Technology Accelerator aims to stimulate innovation and accelerate the delivery of prototype systems related to modeling, simulation and training.Creating Training System Capability Development Document: Marine Corps Systems Command is investing in a series of shooting range training systems, including upgrading the automatic scoring system to provide the Marine Corps with ground-to-ground and air-to-ground target scoring capabilities. At the same time, the Marine Corps is creating the Range Training System Capability Development Document (CDD). The document will include physical targets that Marine Corps ground and aviation units can engage with a large number of weapons and platforms, including armored vehicles and fixed-wing aircraft, to support on-site training. In addition, the Marine Corps Command is creating capability development documents for its ground training system platform. The capability development document will outline common features of the various programs of the system that will enhance interoperability by requiring platforms to use common technical standards and components and extract data from common databases.Development of Joint Weapons Command and Control Training Upgrade System: The Marine Corps is also developing its Joint Weapons Command and Control Training Upgrade System (CACCTUS). This system is an upgraded version of the Marine Corps Synthetic Arms Trainer, which provides command and control system integration and fire support collaborative training capabilities for the Marine Corps Air-ground Task Force, and has two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization capabilities of battlefield space. The Marine Corps plans to issue contract requirements for software support after the system is deployed in September-October, and the specific contract will be awarded in February 2022, with a total value of about $13 million.Other new technology developments: The Marine Corps Training Systems Support and Support Agency (TS4) also hopes to develop new training technologies, and the ongoing project is equipment-related services systems (ERSS). The contract for this project lasts for 10 years and is worth 2. 5%. $4.9 billion, recently awarded to Hatalom, an Orlando-based defense contractor.This summer, the Marine Corps electronics and communication services (ECS) released a 10-year report with a maximum value of 2. 5%. $3.8 billion in contracts. The focus is on software support, including post-deployment assurance and support, network security and software development planning. At the same time, the Bureau of Electronics and Communications is also committed to investing in new training capabilities to solve the problem that the old system cannot meet the changing training needs. The Training and Education Command has more than halved the number of deployable virtual training systems, from 676 to 333. By adopting new technologies, new processes and new methods, the Marine Corps will accelerate the deployment of new training capabilities and the stripping of old systems with the help of industrial partners. For example, M1A1 armored training system and amphibious assault vehicle armored artillery training system will no longer be used in fiscal year 2022. In addition, the inventory of indoor simulated shooting trainers decreased by 57%, from 485 to 206. The system is replaced by an advanced light weapons killing trainer. The Marine Corps is determining the requirements documents of the system and plans to deploy five systems for proof of concept."

        "源标题": "Can the Army’s robotics programs build AI the Silicon Valley way?",
        "原文": "WASHINGTON — Cost overruns and schedule slips abound in the defense business, but at least the Pentagon has plenty of experience building physical weapons. By contrast, training AI algorithms takes very different skills, which the Defense Department and its traditional contractors largely lack.\nThat’s why it’s worth noting that, this morning, a small Silicon Valley company called Applied Intuition announced it had won a contract — brokered by the Pentagon’s embassy in the Valley, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), using its streamlined Commercial Solutions Opening process — to provide software tools for the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle program (RCV). (This contract complements the Army’s existing deals with Qinetiq and Textron to build prototypes). While pocket change by Pentagon procurement standards, with a maximum spend of $49 million over two years, Applied’s contract could help bring private-sector innovation in self-driving vehicles to the armed forces.\n“Commercial industry has a leg up on this, because they’ve invested a tremendous amount into these efforts,” said David Michelson, a former Army infantryman who now manages autonomous systems for DIU. “The industry also understands how to deploy this stuff and how to get these systems and software actually out in the real world.”\nThe Defense Department can’t just hire a contractor to deliver a box of software and then walk away, Michelson emphasized in an interview with Breaking Defense. Military robotics need the same kind of comprehensive development and sustainment pipeline that Tesla, for example, uses to suck in petabytes of data from the sensors on its vehicles, analyze it, and employ it to refine its algorithms — and do it over and over and over, day after day after day, throughout the service life of a program.\nRELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Outgoing DIU head ‘frustrated… we’re not supported’ more by big Pentagon\n“The DoD just hasn’t had that infrastructure in place,” Michelson said. “They don’t have good systems for harvesting that data, managing it, storing it, manipulating it, and sharing it.\n“That’s new for a lot of acquisitions offices out there; they haven’t really had to think about the software development pipeline,” he said. “When you’re fielding a tank, you’re thinking about the logistics tails and the maintenance for it, actually having parts on hand, and the training that goes into that… There’s no thought of software development pipelines, updating algorithms.”\nBut the Defense Department has to start somewhere — and RCV, Michelson said, is “the pathfinder for the Department.”\n‘You Need A Tremendous Amount Of Data On The Ground’\nMichelson’s team at DIU had hitherto focused on getting off-the-shelf civilian mini-drones approved and available for military use, such as the Skydio RQ-28A quadcopter entering Army service this fall. Now Michelson is taking on the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle. But RCV is a much more complex challenge, because it has to move on land.\n“There’s not a lot you’re going to hit in the sky,” Michelson said. “In the air, you can deal with several seconds of latency [between spotting an obstacle and reacting]. On the ground, if you have several seconds of latency, good luck. You’re going to run into a lot of different issues” — sometimes, literally run into them.\nEven the latest driver-assistance algorithms still struggle to recognize moving objects — pedestrians, bicyclists, other vehicles — in time to hit the brakes. And AI gets even harder when you go offroad, said Colin Carroll, an intelligence officer in the Marine Corps Reserve who headed Project Maven and helped run JAIC before joining the government relations office of Applied Intuition.\n“On-road you have lanes, you have markers, there’s a set rule of the road that everybody, in theory, is following around you,” Carroll said in an interview. “If you hit something, that is a fail, doesn’t matter what it is: a [traffic] cone, a person, another car, a tree.\n“Off-road, though, you might want to hit something,” he continued. “If you’re in a tank, you can hit a tree and just run it over.”\nSo vehicles that drive themselves off-road not only need to recognize potential obstacles, as on-road AIs do; They must also decide what they must drive around and what they can safely drive through. That depends on the construction of the vehicle, the nature of the obstacle, and the physics of how they interact. Can the robot brush aside that low-hanging branch, or will it break something? Can it drive through that mud, or will it get stuck? Is that water ahead an inch-deep puddle, or a pond?\nThe private sector is investing heavily in this problem, too. “There is quite a lot of money going into offroad mobility,” said Carroll, “[from companies like] Kamatsu, Caterpillar, John Deere.”\nBut military vehicles face an additional layer of complications that commercial offroad autonomy doesn’t. Most obviously: Someone is out there trying to kill you. That means military maneuver, as opposed to mere movement, has to take into account available cover and open ground. A “safe” path, in a military sense, requires not only navigating around obstacles, but calculating lines of sight from potential enemy positions so you can avoid driving through their kill zones. A robot on a reconnaissance mission, or an armed one, also needs to position itself to maximize its own field of fire, which requires guessing at where the enemy will be.\nMore subtly, a military vehicle may not set out with a specific destination defined in precise coordinates. Instead, it may have a broader mission — “search and destroy,” for instance, or “patrol this area” — that requires defining new destinations on the fly to avoid threats or hunt potential targets.\n“I’m not aware of … a single one of our [commercial] customers that’s [saying] ‘we’re going to go for a drive today and we don’t know where we’re going to wind up, and the machine’s going to figure that out,’” Carroll said. “No one’s investing commercial dollars in figuring that out.”\nPenetrating this kind of fog of war requires much more sophisticated algorithms crunching even more data than civilian offroad navigation.\nAll told, Michelson said, “you need a tremendous amount of data on the ground.”\nLet’s Get Digital, Digital\nThe good news is that you do not need to build an inch-by-inch digital map of everywhere you want your robotic ground vehicles to go. (Even if you could, it would be immediately outdated in a war zone, where explosions can change the landscape in an instant). Instead, Michelson and Carroll explained, you can use your data to teach your AI to navigate in enough specific situations that — like a human infant — it learns to generalize and can start handling unfamiliar environments on its own.\nWhat’s more, they argued, AI can do a lot of that learning in a simulation. By creating a detailed virtual environment and feeding the algorithms the kind of data their sensors would see in the physical world, you can run through the hundreds of repetitions required at a fraction of the time and cost involved in real-world driving — and with zero risk of accidents. Simulation is especially useful for testing collisions and other hazards that would destroy a physical prototype.\n“There’s no substitute for real data,” Michelson cautioned, “[but] once you get digital, you can do it over and over and over.”\nDoing it over and over and over is essential, because you can’t stop with software version 1.0. Autonomy developers start off testing their vehicles in small, self-contained environments before gradually exposing the algorithms to greater variety and complexity: bad weather, nighttime lightning, different types of terrain, different regions of the world.\n“It’s not like Lord of the Rings, where there’s one algorithm to rule them all,” Michelson said. “You can simultaneously train multiple ‘stacks’ — and a stack is the full pipeline of autonomous vehicle software.”\nThis AI training doesn’t stop with the delivery of the initial software, any more than the supply of spare parts stops when the first physical vehicle is delivered. Updates must continue through the software’s service life as it takes on new missions in new regions in a changing world. The military might even need to systematically conduct mission-specific data-gathering and software updates before deploying robots abroad, just as units today conduct “intelligence preparation of the battlefield” and pre-deployment training. And it would need to update its AI with new data after every battle, just as human troops conduct After-Action Reviews.\nIt’s a huge endeavor. The mechanized armies of the industrial age lived — or died — on a constant flow of fuel, spare parts, and ammunition. The unmanned armies of the AI era will require a constant flow of data, from the frontline back to the developers, and software updates from the developers to the frontline.\n“If you have a bunch of robots out in the field in an operational environment but you have no way again to get that data back, you won’t learn why it’s failing, if it’s failing,” Michelson said. “If you think that you’re going to carry around a bunch of USB sticks for updates and put them in every single robot, that’s just inefficient.”\n",

For operation, the heavy fuel SP-180 SRE needs a kerosene/oil mixture with a ratio of 200:1 (Jet A1 : Aspen 2-stroke oil). Engine cooling is provided by water cooling of the housing and oil cooling of the rotor, allowing reliable operation under severe environmental conditions.\nThe heavy fuel SP-180 HF SRE can be operated as a direct drive, hybrid application or in an electrical power generation mode. With hybrid boost power, an additional 15KW is optionally available for direct drive, depending on the capacity of the on-board battery. Conventional generators as well as starter generators are available depending on customer application and requirements with the latter having to be connected to a 48V battery pack with the preheater unit. The capacity and peak current of the battery must be large enough to supply the current required to preheat the engine and start the combustion cycle.\n“Heavy fuel engines have a long history with us, as we have been offering our two-stroke engines in this configuration for a very long time. Now, we are pleased to be able to use our wankel engine for this fuel type, as well for military applications, notable the NATO single fuel policy,” explains Karsten Schudt, Managing Director of Sky Power GmbH.

        "源标题": "The U.S. Army has officially reactivated the 56th Artillery Command in Germany. This unit was previously active in that country between 1963 and 1991, during which time it commanded battalions armed with Pershing and Pershing II nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. In its new guise, it will serve as a hub for artillery operations across Europe, including deployments of new ground-based hypersonic weapons and other longer-range missiles in the coming years. This reflects just how important the Army feels these new capabilities, and artillery in general, would be in any future major conflict in the region, especially against Russia.",
        "原文": "The Army officially stood up the 56th Artillery Command in Mainz-Kastel, Germany, today, but news that the unit would return to active duty had emerged in August. The command is assigned to U.S. Army Europe and Africa, which oversees all conventional Army operations on both of those continents.\nThe 56th is co-located in Mainz-Kastel with the Army's second so-called Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF). The service's MDTFs, the first of which was established at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State, are still-evolving units that are being used as testbeds to explore the introduction of new weapons and other capabilities. They are expected to have an operational role, especially in any future high-end conflict against a major opponent such as Russia or China.\n\"The reactivation of the 56th Artillery Command will provide U.S. Army Europe and Africa with significant capabilities in multi-domain operations,\" Army Maj. Gen. Stephen Maranian, the head of the newly revived unit, said in a statement on Nov. 3. \"It will further enable the synchronization of joint and multinational fires and effects, and employment of future long-range surface to surface fires across the U.S. Army Europe and Africa area of responsibility.\"\nMaranian's mention of \"future long-range surface to surface fires\" is clearly a reference, at least in part, to two new missile systems the Army hopes to begin fielding in the next few years — Dark Eagle and Typhon.\nDark Eagle is the still relatively new name for the Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), which it is developing as part of a joint program with the U.S. Navy. The service is already in the process of standing up the first battery that will be equipped with these missiles, each of which carries an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, as part of the MDTF at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.\nTyphon, which the Army has also referred to as its future Mid-Range Capability (MRC), is a multi-purpose system that includes launchers and fire control systems that will be able to employ various types of missiles. At present, the service plans to use Typhon to fire land-based derivatives of the Navy's SM-6 missile, which has air- and missile-defense capabilities as well as the ability to strike surface targets, along with ground-launched versions of the Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile. The Army is expected to use its version of the SM-6 as a surface-to-surface ballistic missile..\nThe Army is in the process of acquiring a new conventionally armed ballistic missile, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which could eventually have a range of over 310 miles. There has been talk in recent years about the service fielding other new longer-range ballistic missiles, as well.\nThere is historical significance to reactivating the 56th Artillery Command, specifically, to oversee the future employment of these weapons in Europe. Dark Eagle, Typhon, and a future PrSM, would all have previously been banned under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which collapsed in 2019.\nThe United States and the Soviet Union signed this agreement in 1987. The INF entered into force the following year, and both sides implemented the provisions even as the Soviet Union collapsed and a new Russia emerged in 1991. The treaty was directly responsible for the removal of the Pershing II missile from Army service, which was then a key factor in the decision to stand down the 56th just over three decades ago. U.S. Air Force units armed with the BGM-109G Gryphon, an earlier ground-launched Tomahawk variant, were also eliminated as a result of the INF.\nThough the U.S. and Russian governments continue to talk about possible follow-ons to the INF, as well as other future arms control arrangements, the return of the 56th makes clear that the Army is preparing to deploy units armed with weapons like Dark Eagle and Typhon to Europe on some level in the coming years. Those deployments may ultimately be rotational or otherwise non-permanent due to the willingness, or lack thereof, of even America's NATO allies to host these weapons.\nAt the same time, while the Army's revival of the 56th is clearly linked to its future missile capabilities, the unit will also have a broader and perhaps more important role simply as a hub for managing all its artillery units across Europe. This includes those that will be equipped with new longer-range howitzers and rocket artillery. In recent years, the service has already been steadily standing up new units in the region to go along with these new capabilities, as it has broadly refocused its attention, on preparing for a potential conflict with Russia.\nArmy leaders have warned for years now that the Russian Army has clear advantages in artillery capabilities, as well as in raw numbers of self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers. Any future conflict in Europe would almost certainly see the relatively rapid deployment of additional artillery units to the region, which would then need higher-level commands to manage their operations. This is one of the 56th's core jobs, along with acting as a focal point for coordinating Army artillery elements with units from other services, as well as NATO allies and other partners, who would likely be fighting alongside American troops in any potential high-end fight in the region.\nThe MDTF at Mainz-Kastel is a key element in all of this, as well. This unit would likely be in direct charge of actually employing new weapons and other systems, such as Dark Eagle and Typhon, as well as advanced networking capabilities that will improve the effectiveness and flexibility of artillery and other Army units in general. In a prime example of the kinds of experimentation these task forces are engaged in, the European MDTF brought high-altitude balloons carrying sensors and communication nodes to an exercise in Norway this past September. The Army's 41st Field Artillery Brigade, a rocket artillery unit that was stood up in Germany in 2018, participated in that drill and used the balloons to help find and engage targets at extended ranges.\n“If you look at echelons above brigade, what we’re having to do is build out our capacity to fight large-scale, campaign-quality combat,” now-retired Army Lt. Gen. Eric Wesley, who was then serving as the deputy commander of Army Futures Command and head of its Futures and Concepts Center, told reporters last year. “Those echelons we have mortgaged a bit in the last 20 or 30 years because our BCTs [Brigade Combat Teams] were so powerful relative to our opponent.\"\nThe return of the 56th Artillery Command to Germany after more than 30 years underscores just how vital the Army sees artillery, including new weapons, such as Dark Eagle and Typhon, being in a future major conflict in the region, potentially one involving Russia.\n",

This latest research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports, uses mathematical modeling to prove the concept of using MMTs in artificial intelligence systems, which is a vital step towards manufacturing.\nUsing measured and simulated transistor data, the researchers show that well-designed multimodal transistors could operate robustly as rectified linear unit-type (ReLU) activations in artificial neural networks, achieving practically identical classification accuracy as pure ReLU implementations. They used both measured and simulated MMT data to train an artificial neural network to identify handwritten numbers and compared the results with the built-in ReLU of the software. The results confirmed the potential of MMT devices for thin-film decision and classification circuits. The same approach could be used in more complex AI systems.\nUnusually, the research was led by Surrey undergraduate Isin Pesch, who worked on the project during the final year research module of her BEng (Hons) in Electronic Engineering with Nanotechnology.

        "源标题": "Heritage Foundation Ranks Air Force and Space Force as ‘Weak’ in New Report",
        "原文": "The Heritage Foundation ranked both the Air Force and the Space Force as “weak” in its 2022 Index of U.S. Military Strength released Oct. 20, citing issues ranging from low readiness and misaligned investment in fourth-generation platforms to insufficient space domain awareness and offensive space weapons to match peer capabilities.\nHeritage, a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank, rated Air Force capacity and capability as “marginal,” its middle ranking, while scoring readiness and the overall Air Force as “weak” on a five-point scale of very weak to very strong. The Air Force’s low ranking in readiness hinges on an annual average of 130 flight hours for pilots and insufficient investment in fifth-generation stealth aircraft most capable of facing peer adversaries. The Space Force was rated as “weak” across the board.\n“On the Air Force, we’re a bit puzzled by its investment strategy,” index editor Dakota Wood said. The analyst said the Air Force was “spending more on research and development to have an Air Force that it would like to have in the 2030s, while it’s not buying enough of current production aircraft to replace its aging current fleet.”\nThe demands of two decades of war wore out the fleet, which has an average age of 31 years. Research and development dollars continue to outpace procurement, and the Air Force plans to cut 137 fighters and 32 tankers from its fleet by the end of fiscal 2022, leaving it at 69 percent of the Air Force that last fought a peer rival, the report finds.\n“USAF currently is at 86 percent of the capacity required” to fight two major regional contingency operations, according to the report. “However, the disposition of those assets limits the ability of the service to deploy them rapidly to a crisis region. While the active fighter and bomber assets that are available would likely prove adequate to fight and win a single regional conflict, when coupled with the low mission capability rates of those aircraft …, the global sourcing needed to field the required combat fighter force assets would leave the rest of the world uncovered.”\nUsing the 2018 National Defense Strategy as a guidepost, the report cites mission capable rates of between 52 and 74 percent for legacy aircraft (fourth-generation and below) as insufficient to face a peer rival. It also notes a shortfall of 1,925 pilots, a number that improved slightly over the past year due to the lack of commercial hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also highlighted historic lows in sortie rates at less than 1.5 per week and flying time at 131 hours per year.\nThe report says the low rates are far below “healthy fighter force thresholds” of three sorties a week and 200 hours a year per pilot.\nCOVID had a severe effect on flight hours and sorties, the report assesses, and Heritage states that it will take several years of training for fighter pilots to recover what they lost in 2020. “Unfortunately, the Air Force is not moving on that path and will cut 87,479 flying hours from its budget in FY 2022—a reduction of 7 percent,” the report states.\nSenior research fellow John “JV” Venable, 25-year Air Force veteran, told Air Force Magazine the purchase of fourth-generation aircraft over fifth-generation platforms puts the U.S. at a clear disadvantage against a peer rival.\n“The Chinese and the Russians do not fear fourth-generation platforms,” he said. “But they do fear the F-35. That says a lot about what we should be buying right now.”\nThe Air Force asked to buy 12 F-15EXs in its 2022 budget request and included another dozen F-15EXs in its 2022 unfunded priorities list. However, in a notable break from tradition, the service did not request any new F-35 strike fighters in its 2022 unfunded priorities list.\n“We could be applying that funding into the fifth-gen fighter force and actually moving the ball forward with regard to capability of our assets,” Venable said.\nNeither the Air Force nor Space Force could immediately respond to a request for comment on the report’s findings.\nSpace Force Gets Failing Grade\nVenable said the report rates the 2-year-old Space Force as “weak” based on aging and unprotected satellites, lack of space domain awareness, and insufficient offensive and defensive capabilities.\n“The Space Force is not capable of meeting current—much less future—on-demand, operational, and tactical-level warfighter requirements,” states the report.\nVenable said the Marshall Islands-based Lockheed Martin radar tracking system called Space Fence, which went online in 2020, only provides updates on the movement of some 26,000 objects every two hours.\n“In between those two hours, what those platforms do, those satellites or missiles, … we wouldn’t have known that because of the limitation on our spaceborne and our land-based surveillance platforms,” he said, citing recent reports that China flew a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicle through space in August.\nVenable said the Space Force needs radars and satellites with optics to see spaceborne platforms and changes in the domain on a more regular basis.\nHouse Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama agreed that space-based platforms are lacking.\n“Space-based platforms, unmanned assets, and more distributed logistics capabilities are essential to deterring China,” he said, also citing reports of the Chinese hypersonic missile test.\n“We’re not in a good place,” Rogers told Air Force Magazine in a pull-aside interview when asked about U.S. hypersonics progress an event launch marking the launch of the report. “What I’m telling you is that we’ve got some things going on that are going to put us in a great place.”\nRogers, who keynoted the launch event, cited classified information in the hypersonics area that was “really exciting.” He also said he is not worried about recent Air Force failed hypersonics tests.\n“It’s one of the things I keep trying to get members to get accustomed to,” he said. “I want people to push the envelope and fail because every time you test and fail, you learn something. That’s how Kim Jong Un finally developed a missile that could reach the United States.”\nThe report is complimentary of the President’s proposed $17.4 billion 2022 budget for Space Force, a 13 percent increase over FY 21, but it highlights ongoing growing pains.\nHeritage praises Space Force for assimilating 60 disparate offices related to space from across DOD in its first two years, but warned that a significant portion of the 21,200 space professionals that remain in the Army and Navy must be incorporated into the Space Force to “remedy the dysfunctional oversight or command and control issues that the Space Force initiative was intended to resolve.”\nThe report says it is not likely such transfers will be complete until fiscal year 2024 or later. The transferring of space-related units and missions from the Army and Navy has been delayed by the failure of Congress to pass a 2022 budget.\nVenable said the Space Force is also behind adversaries such as China in terms of offensive capabilities in space. He said the U.S. has ground-based blinding assets that can temporarily impede a satellite’s operations, whereas China has anti-satellite missiles on Earth and laser platforms on orbit right now.\n“We have no true, at least unclassified, systems that can take an offensive punch to the Chinese,” he said.\nRogers also addressed the Space Force’s apparent lack of space weapons compared to the known capabilities of adversaries China and Russia.\n“We intentionally are moving or developing Space Force in a layered effort over a five- or six-year period,” he said. “I expect us to, as it matures, to continue to put more and more money in what they’re developing both offensively and defensively. So, I’m pretty pleased with where we are there. I would like to be pacing that well in other areas.”\n",

        "原文": "Imagine a more sustainable future, where cellphones, smartwatches, and other wearable devices don't have to be shelved or discarded for a newer model. Instead, they could be upgraded with the latest sensors and processors that would snap onto a device's internal chip—like LEGO bricks incorporated into an existing build. Such reconfigurable chipware could keep devices up to date while reducing our electronic waste.\nNow MIT engineers have taken a step toward that modular vision with a LEGO-like design for a stackable, reconfigurable artificial intelligence chip.\nThe design comprises alternating layers of sensing and processing elements, along with light-emitting diodes (LED) that allow for the chip's layers to communicate optically. Other modular chip designs employ conventional wiring to relay signals between layers. Such intricate connections are difficult if not impossible to sever and rewire, making such stackable designs not reconfigurable.\nThe MIT design uses light, rather than physical wires, to transmit information through the chip. The chip can therefore be reconfigured, with layers that can be swapped out or stacked on, for instance to add new sensors or updated processors.\n\"You can add as many computing layers and sensors as you want, such as for light, pressure, and even smell,\" says MIT postdoc Jihoon Kang. \"We call this a LEGO-like reconfigurable AI chip because it has unlimited expandability depending on the combination of layers.\"\nThe researchers are eager to apply the design to edge computing devices—self-sufficient sensors and other electronics that work independently from any central or distributed resources such as supercomputers or cloud-based computing.\n\"As we enter the era of the internet of things based on sensor networks, demand for multifunctioning edge-computing devices will expand dramatically,\" says Jeehwan Kim, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. \"Our proposed hardware architecture will provide high versatility of edge computing in the future.\"\nThe team's results are published in Nature Electronics.\nLighting the way\nThe team's design is currently configured to carry out basic image-recognition tasks. It does so via a layering of image sensors, LEDs, and processors made from artificial synapses—arrays of memory resistors, or \"memristors,\" that the team previously developed, which together function as a physical neural network, or \"brain-on-a-chip.\" Each array can be trained to process and classify signals directly on a chip, without the need for external software or an Internet connection.\nIn their new chip design, the researchers paired image sensors with artificial synapse arrays, each of which they trained to recognize certain letters—in this case, M, I, and T. While a conventional approach would be to relay a sensor's signals to a processor via physical wires, the team instead fabricated an optical system between each sensor and artificial synapse array to enable communication between the layers, without requiring a physical connection.\n\"Other chips are physically wired through metal, which makes them hard to rewire and redesign, so you'd need to make a new chip if you wanted to add any new function,\" says MIT postdoc Hyunseok Kim. \"We replaced that physical wire connection with an optical communication system, which gives us the freedom to stack and add chips the way we want.\"\nThe team's optical communication system consists of paired photodetectors and LEDs, each patterned with tiny pixels. Photodetectors constitute an image sensor for receiving data, and LEDs to transmit data to the next layer. As a signal (for instance an image of a letter) reaches the image sensor, the image's light pattern encodes a certain configuration of LED pixels, which in turn stimulates another layer of photodetectors, along with an artificial synapse array, which classifies the signal based on the pattern and strength of the incoming LED light.\nStacking up\nThe team fabricated a single chip, with a computing core measuring about 4 square millimeters, or about the size of a piece of confetti. The chip is stacked with three image recognition \"blocks,\" each comprising an image sensor, optical communication layer, and artificial synapse array for classifying one of three letters, M, I, or T. They then shone a pixellated image of random letters onto the chip and measured the electrical current that each neural network array produced in response. (The larger the current, the larger the chance that the image is indeed the letter that the particular array is trained to recognize.)\nThe team found that the chip correctly classified clear images of each letter, but it was less able to distinguish between blurry images, for instance between I and T. However, the researchers were able to quickly swap out the chip's processing layer for a better \"denoising\" processor, and found the chip then accurately identified the images.\n\"We showed stackability, replaceability, and the ability to insert a new function into the chip,\" notes MIT postdoc Min-Kyu Song.\nThe researchers plan to add more sensing and processing capabilities to the chip, and they envision the applications to be boundless.\n\"We can add layers to a cellphone's camera so it could recognize more complex images, or makes these into healthcare monitors that can be embedded in wearable electronic skin,\" offers Choi, who along with Kim previously developed a \"smart\" skin for monitoring vital signs.\nAnother idea, he adds, is for modular chips, built into electronics, that consumers can choose to build up with the latest sensor and processor \"bricks.\"\n\"We can make a general chip platform, and each layer could be sold separately like a video game,\" Jeehwan Kim says. \"We could make different types of neural networks, like for image or voice recognition, and let the customer choose what they want, and add to an existing chip like a LEGO.\"\nIn addition to Kim and Kang, MIT authors include co-first authors Chanyeol Choi, Hyunseok Kim, and Min-Kyu Song, and contributing authors Hanwool Yeon, Celesta Chang, Jun Min Suh, Jiho Shin, Kuangye Lu, Bo-In Park, Yeongin Kim, Han Eol Lee, Doyoon Lee, Subeen Pang, Sang-Hoon Bae, Hun S.

However, this becomes much trickier when trying to examine microscopic quantum objects like photons—tiny little particles of light.\nThat's because certain properties of quantum objects are connected, and measuring one property can disturb another property. For example, measuring the position of an electron will affect its speed and vice versa.\nSuch properties are called conjugate properties. This is a direct manifestation of Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle—it is not possible to simultaneously measure two conjugate properties of a quantum object with arbitrary accuracy.\nAccording to lead author and ANU Ph.D. researcher Lorcán Conlon, this is one of the defining challenges of quantum mechanics.\n\"We were able to design a measurement to determine conjugate properties of quantum objects more accurately. Remarkably, our collaborators were able to implement this measurement in various labs around the world,\" Conlon said.\n\"More accurate measurements are crucial, and can in turn open up new possibilities for all sorts of technologies, including biomedical sensing, laser ranging, and quantum communications.\"\nThe new technique revolves around a strange quirk of quantum systems, known as entanglement. According to the researchers, by entangling two identical quantum objects and measuring them together, scientists can determine their properties more precisely than if they were measured individually.\n\"By entangling two identical quantum systems, we can acquire more information,\" co-author Dr. Syed Assad said. \"There is some unavoidable noise associated with measuring any property of a quantum system. By entangling the two, we're able to reduce this noise and get a more accurate measurement.\"\nIn theory, it is possible to entangle and measure three or more quantum systems to achieve even better precision, but in this case the experiments failed to agree with the theory. Nevertheless, the authors are confident that future quantum computers will be able to overcome these limitations.\n\"Quantum computers with error-corrected qubits will be able to gainfully measure with more and more copies in the future,\" Conlon said.\nAccording to Professor Ping Koy Lam, A*STAR chief quantum scientist at Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), one of the key strengths of this work is that a quantum-enhancement can still be observed in noisy scenarios.\n\"For practical applications, such as in biomedical measurements, it is important that we can see an advantage even when the signal is inevitably embedded in a noisy real-world environment,\" he said.\nThe study was conducted by experts at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T), in collaboration with researchers from A*STAR's Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), the University of Jena, the University of Innsbruck, and Macquarie University.

Designed to produce an unlimited supply of oxygen for pilots, OBOGS are a critical system for fighter and trainer aircraft. Working closely with the Air Force Research Laboratory’s 711th Human Performance Wing and AFLCMC’s Life Support Systems Scientific Test Analysis & Qualification (LSSSTAQ) Lab, the directorate is working to gather important data and ensure the system will properly operate and supply the pilots with oxygen.\nThe tests have been divided into three phases. The first phase was conducted at the LSSSTAQ lab and consisted of unmanned altitude chamber testing. The Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence used design of experiments to assist in dynamic changing of parameters during testing runs. This allowed for 40 times more information to be collected on the T-7 OBOGS system compared to other platforms. In phase two, the team collaborated with the 711th Human Performance Wing, using their man-rated centrifuge and the newly man-rated Research Altitude Chambers to conduct manned and unmanned acceleration testing and manned altitude chamber testing. For this phase, volunteer U.S. Air Force pilots and volunteer human subject panel members were used.\n“We’re testing a brand new configuration of OBOGS. The configuration we’re going to be using on the T-7 has not been used on any other platform. With that manned altitude testing we did everything from BOS duration testing to breathing impedance testing, where we had subjects peddling on bicycles to simulate workload in the aircraft, to rapid decompression testing that covered the gamut of the operational envelope for the T-7,” said Jessica Allen, T-7A Crew Systems Lead with the directorate.\n“The LSSSTAQ lab did an extensive job testing and challenging the system during the first phase, which gave us a high level of confidence moving forward into the manned testing phase,” said Maj. Daniel Catrambone, Research Physiology Operations Lead at the 711th Human Performance Wing.”\nThe U.S. Air Force had 18 different human subject panel members and 10 fighter pilot volunteers. Acceleration testing was performed in the centrifuge in gradual and rapid onset rates up to 8.5Gs. The third phase of testing is scheduled to begin in the near future in the LSSSTAQ lab and will be comprised of environmental testing. Upon completion of phase three, the OBOGS system will be installed onto five T-7 aircraft for flight testing later this year.

        "原文": "Researchers in the US have created quantum dots using room-temperature biochemical reactions that are catalysed by an synthetic protein. Developed by Leah Spangler, Michael Hecht and colleagues at Princeton University, the technique could lead to more sustainable methods for manufacturing quantum dots on industrial scales.\nQuantum dots are nanocrystals of semiconductor materials that have useful quantum properties that fall between those of bulk materials and individual atoms. With exciting applications including solar cells, LED displays and quantum technologies, research into quantum dots is a hot topic. However, the manufacture of these tiny semiconductor structures often requires both high temperatures and toxic solvents – so researchers are on the look-out for ways of making quantum dots that are more environmentally friendly.\nIn the study, the team investigated how quantum dots could be made using finely tuned biochemical reactions that involve a protein that does not exist naturally in biological systems. Instead, the protein was made in the lab by combining naturally-occurring amino acids.\nMaking metals safe\nThat protein is called Construct K (ConK) and it was first synthesized in 2016. Previous work has shown that ConK allows E Coli bacteria to survive toxic concentrations of copper. Although the chemical mechanisms that boost bacterial survival are not fully understood, scientists suspect that it involves catalysis processes that cause metal atoms to bind to molecules – rendering the atoms less toxic. In nature, a similar process is achieved by natural proteins found in some types of bacteria that can live in high concentrations of metals.\nQuantum dots are often made from compound semiconductors such as cadmium sulphide – which includes the toxic metal cadmium. As a result, Hecht and colleagues predicted that ConK could be used in the synthesis of cadmium sulphide quantum dots. The team found that ConK was able to catalyse the breakdown of the amino acid cysteine, creating by-products including hydrogen sulphide. This compound can then react with cadmium to create the cadmium sulphide nanocrystals.\nWhen compared to natural proteins, Hecht’s team found that its new approach has two key advantages that are related to the slower growth of the nanocrystals when created using ConK. One advantage is that the cadmium sulphide nanocrystals are created mostly with the same crystal structure, rather than with a mixture of two different crystal structures. The second is that the nanocrystals stabilize at sizes of roughly 3 nm, albeit in slightly irregular shapes.\n“The quantum dots we’re making aren’t great quality yet, but that can be improved by tuning the synthesis,” says Spangler. “We can achieve better quality by engineering the protein to influence quantum dot formation in different ways.”\nIn the future, they hope this technique could lead to the industrial-scale manufacture of stable, high-quality quantum dots at room temperature – ensuring a more sustainable future for the rapidly-growing quantum dot industry.\nThe research is described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n",

The test will be conducted between a 10kg Unseenlabs nanosatellite and a portable compact ground station designed by Cailabs.\nA satellite will be designed and put into orbit by Unseenlabs at the end of 2022. According to the company, the success of this groundbreaking operation would make possible a rapid deployment of laser communications below the stratosphere, thanks in large part to Unseenlabs’ modern and agile nano-satellite architecture, combined with Cailabs’ ground receiver technology.\n“Compared to a traditional radio link, it offers greater speed, better discretion, and removes the constraint of having to share emission frequencies with other users.” says a statement published by Unseenlabs. “However atmospheric turbulences can easily disrupt an optical transmission of data, it must be adjusted and corrected at ground level. The adaptive optical technologies currently used are impractical in terms of size and mobility.”\nFlorence Parly, French Minister of Defense, announced at the Defense Innovation Forum the testing of a laser based optical communication system between a nano-satellite and a compact and transportable ground station. A world first.\nThe KERAUNOS (“lightning” in ancient Greek) project aims to test an innovative, high speed optical communication link between a 10-kg nano-satellite and a compact ground station. Optical communication improves the data rate and stealth of wireless communications. It is sometimes disturbed by atmospheric turbulence, which Keraunos aims to mitigate for optimal transmission quality. The project is led by French start-ups Unseenlabs and Cailabs, major French players in the New Space sector, in which the Ministry has a stake via Definvest, its investment fund co-managed with Bpifrance. The satellite is scheduled for launch in late 2022.\nThe Defense Innovation Agency (AID) is providing 5.5 million in funding for this innovation acceleration project, which is a world first.\nIn accordance with the guidelines of the French President of the Republic, Florence Parly, Minister of Defense, has made space a strategic defense priority. The Military Programming Law (LPM) devotes 4.3 billion to space over the 2019-2025 period. Within this framework, a Syracuse telecommunications satellite and three CERES intelligence satellites were successfully launched on 24 October and 16 November 2021.\nThe KERAUNOS project consists in experimenting, as early as 2022, optical data transmission from a nano satellite, designed and launched in low orbit by Unseenlabs, to a compact and lightweight reception solution from Cailabs. The modern and agile software architecture of Unseenlabs nano-satellites offers the possibility to integrate this laser payload in the New Space tempo.\nThe advantages of the optical link, compared to usual radio links, include higher throughput, enhances stealth and freedom from sharing transmission frequencies between different users. However, atmospheric turbulence disturbs data transmission from the satellite, requiring correction at the ground receiver level. The technologies currently used, based on adaptive optics, are bulky and unmovable.\nCailabs’ technology, which will be tested during the KERAUNOS project, overcomes the constraints that prevent industrial or operational use of optical ground stations. If successful, the experiment would be a world first in high-speed optical satellite communication including atmospheric turbulence processing without adaptive optics. This success would enable rapid deployment of laser communications on mobile, land, naval or air platforms. This system could eventually be integrated into future Ministry of Defense satellite systems.\nThe New Space is a new age of industry and space economy characterized by the emergence of private actors bringing new working methods, innovative technologies, as well as significant private investments. The Ministry of Armed Forces is closely monitoring the development of advances made by French start-ups in this field and is supporting those that could lead to dual applications, both civilian and military.\n",

        "原文": "The Ripsaw is better known for its action movie pedigree, but the Army's unmanned version packs a very real 30mm cannon.\nBY JOSEPH TREVITHICK AUGUST 4, 2021\nThe U.S. Army recently conducted the first live-fire testing with one of its prototype 30mm cannon-armed Ripsaw M5 unmanned mini-tanks, which are derived from a series of vehicles that have probably seen more time on movie screens than on the range.\nThe service also demonstrated the ability to operate the vehicle from a control station installed inside a modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle, highlighting the potential for pairing M5s with manned platforms in the future. This sort of \"loyal wingman\" type role is one potential mission set the Army has said it is looking at for the Ripsaws, or similar future designs, which it has acquired are part of a broader effort to expand the use of unmanned ground vehicles across the service.\nPersonnel from two different components of the Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), the Armaments Center at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, and the Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC) at the Detroit Arsenal in Michigan, together with contractors from Booz Allen Hamilton, joined together to carry out the live-fire testing. The actual shooting took place at Fort Dix in New Jersey on July 30. The service's Next-Generation Combat Vehicle Cross-Functional Team (NGCV CFT), part of Army Futures Command, is overseeing all testing of the M5 as part of the Robotic Combat Vehicle-Medium (RCV-M) program.\nMaking sure this turret, which is relatively large compared to the rest of the M5, works on the vehicle is key to Army's entire vision for the RCV-M. The service has previously said that the unmanned vehicle would need to have sufficient \"lethality to defeat some Tier I threats,\" a category that includes hostile vehicles armed with medium-caliber guns, large recoilless rifles, or multiple anti-tank guided missiles.\nThe Army picked the M5 as the winner of its RCV-M competition in January 2020. However, it's important to note that this was not the first time the Army has tested Ripsaw variants, including driver-optional versions. Examples have also made appearances in multiple Hollywood blockbusters, including G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Fast and Furious 8: Fate of the Furious, and Mad Max: Fury Road. The name M5 actually refers to the fact that this is the fifth generation of the Ripsaw design, which has often been characterized most by its high speed for a tracked vehicle. Early, stripped-down versions have demonstrated the ability to get up to 65 miles per hour on improved roads\nWhile the M5, and its armament specifically, was the focus of the testing last week, it also highlighted how the Army might field a fleet of RCV-Ms in the future. Operators fired the weapons on the unmanned mini-tank remotely using a control station installed inside a Mission Enabling Technologies Demonstrator (MET-D) vehicle. \nThe MET-D is a modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle designed to, among other things, provide a mobile control center for unmanned ground vehicles. Previous Army tests showed that personnel riding in the MET-D could control two other unmanned vehicles, modified M113 armored personnel carriers, and that the entire trio could operate a single team. The MET-D also has an array of additional capabilities, including an advanced communications and data-sharing suite and cameras positioned around the hull to improve situational awareness.\n",

        "原文": "By combining scanning electron microscopy with ultrashort laser pulses, researchers in the US have shown that cubic boron arsenide has an important property that could be used to create better solar cells and photodetectors. Usama Choudhry and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Houston used scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) to confirm that “hot” electrons in the semiconductor material have long lifetimes – something that could be useful in a wide range of applications in electronics.\nSometimes dubbed a “wonder material”, cubic boron arsenide is a semiconductor material with several promising properties that could lead to its widespread commercial use. It is a much better conductor of heat than silicon, so it could be used to create integrated circuits that are packed together at higher densities and run at higher frequencies. The material has an electron mobility that is on par with silicon, but it has a much higher hole mobility than silicon – a property that would be useful in designing electronic devices.\nNow, Choudhry and colleagues have shown that cubic boron arsenide has another useful property: long-lived “hot” electrons. When light falls on a semiconductor it can cause the excitation of electrons with a range of energies. The lower energy electrons can persist for long enough so that they can be collected to create an electrical current – which is the basis for solar cells and light detectors. However, in most semiconductors the higher-energy hot electrons have very short lifetimes and are therefore lost before they can be collected.\nLong lived hot electrons\nCalculations done in 2017 suggested that hot electrons have relatively long lifetimes in cubic boron arsenide. However, limitations in fabricating and studying cubic boron arsenide crystals had made it difficult to confirm this prediction.\nREAD MOREAn artist's sketch of cubic boron arsenide, incorporating a ball-and-stick model of the chemical with four blue balls (representing arsenic atoms) and 14 smaller red balls (representing boron atoms). In the background is a burst of fuzzy purple-and blue lines suggesting movement of electrons\nIn their study Choudhry’s team used SUEM, which combines the temporal resolution of ultrashort laser pulses with the spatial resolution of scanning electron microscopy. The technique involves splitting the laser pulse into two parts. The first part of the pulse is used to excite hot electrons in a high-quality sample of cubic boron arsenide that was made by the Houston team. After a carefully controlled delay, the second part of the pulse is focused onto a photocathode. This generates an electron pulse that is just a few picoseconds long. This pulse is used by an electron microscope to characterize the electrons in the cubic boron arsenide.\nBy changing the delay, the team could measure the lifetime of the fast electrons in the sample, revealing that they persist for over 200 ps, which is far longer than the hot charge carriers in most semiconductors used in solar cells. The researchers say that the long lifetime suggests cubic boron arsenide could be used to make better solar cells, but much more work is needed to improve fabrication techniques.\nThe research is described in Matter.\n",

The technology can scale to other missions and aircraft.\nThe NGJ is a tactical electronic jammer pod that replaces the 40-plus-year ALQ-99 jammer system on the EA-18G -- a version of the Navy's carrier-based two-seat F/A-18F Super Hornet jet fighter-bomber that is modified specially for electronic warfare.\nThe EA-18G leads an airborne attack by disrupting enemy radar, communications, and computer networks with jamming signals and computer viruses. The aircraft also can destroy enemy radar installations with its AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARM).\nRaytheon's NGJ will integrate the most advanced electronic attack technology into the EA-18G, such as high-powered, agile beam-jamming techniques, and solid-state electronics to deny, degrade and disrupt enemy threats while protecting U.S. and coalition forces.\nRaytheon’s NGJ will provide airborne electronic attack and jamming capabilities, and will include cyber-attack capabilities that use the aircraft's active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar to insert tailored data streams into enemy radar and communications systems.\nThe NGJ also will have an open-systems architecture for future upgrades. Raytheon will use its gallium nitride (GaN)-based AESA technologies for the NGJ design.\nEventually Raytheon engineers may modify the NGJ to install it aboard the F-35 joint strike fighter, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as to other manned aircraft in addition to the EA-18G.\nThe goal of the NGJ technology-development phase is to develop an electronic attack system that will improve airborne electronic attack capabilities against advanced threats through enhanced agility and precision within jamming assignments, increased interoperability, and expanded broadband capability for greater threat coverage against a wide variety of radio frequency emitters, Navy officials say.\nL3Harris Technologies Inc. in Melbourne, Fla., is developing the Next Generation Jammer Low Band (NGJ-LB) in an urgent effort to develop low-band tactical radar jammers using existing technologies for low size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) applications on the EA-18G Growler EW jet.\nL3Harris Technologies won a contract last December to design and build the NGJ-LB, which experts say will be useful in jamming low-band radar systems design to detect stealth aircraft like the F-35 joint strike fighter. The NGJ-LB transmitter will fit in a pod on Station 6 of the EA-18G.\nThe system will enhance the performance of frequency coverage, effective isotropic radiated power, spatial coverage, spectral purity, and polarization; obtain existing contractor data related to transmitter group performance; and assess the potential to deploy an open-systems interim pod solution rapidly.\nOn this order Boeing will do the work at Patuxent River NAS, Md., and in St. Louis, and should be finished by September 2022.\n",

        "原文": "A team of researchers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the University of California at Berkeley and Princeton University has developed plasma-based techniques to build a lens for laser beams with petawatt-scale power. In their paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters, the group describes the two techniques they developed. \nPhysicists conducting work with particle accelerators and fusion research efforts are hopeful that other researchers will build lasers that are more powerful than those currently available. Such work has been held up by the solid-state optics technology used to create lasers—giving them more power would damage the parts used to generate the laser, making them useless. In this new effort, the researchers noted that other researchers have found that plasma can be used to create optic components such as amplifiers and mirrors. They wondered if the same might be true for the kind of lens needed to produce extremely powerful laser beams. They came up with a concept that involved inducing patterns of high and low density in a given plasma. Light moving through it, they note, would experience a phase shift based on the density of the plasma.\nThe researchers did not actually build such a laser, but instead, proposed two ways that it might be built. The first method involved firing two pump lasers at a gas sample. The first laser ionized the gas into a plasma, while the second did not. The result was a plasma with a bulls-eye configuration of high and low-density plasma rings, which could be used as a laser lens.\nThe second approach involved firing two pump lasers at an already existing plasma in a way that pushed some parts of it toward high intensity areas while others were pushed to low areas. The end result, as with the first approach, was the development of a bulls-eye configuration that could be used as a high-powered laser lens.\nThe researchers created simulations to test their ideas and found that the first approach could be used to create laser beams with intensities up to 1015 W/cm2, while the second could be used to create beams with intensities as high as 1018 W/cm2.\n",

        "原文": "WASHINGTON — The Air Force’s secretive and highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance fighter program has started its crucial engineering and manufacturing development phase, Secretary Frank Kendall said Wednesday.\nIn a discussion at the Heritage Foundation, Kendall said the Air Force began early experimental prototyping on NGAD in 2015, when he was the Pentagon’s top acquisition official. This was essentially an X-plane program, he said, designed to reduce risk and develop key technologies needed for the production program.\nThe technology has continued to progress, he said, and the NGAD effort is now envisioned as a “family of systems” incorporating several elements, including a handful of autonomous drone aircraft accompanying the manned aircraft in formation.\nIt typically takes the Air Force’s acquisition programs almost seven years to reach initial operating capability from the beginning of the EMD phase. Although the service has already been working on NGAD for about that long, because it just recently started work on the EMD phase, it will still be several more years before the program will reach IOC.\n“The clock really didn’t start in 2015; it’s starting roughly now,” Kendall said. “We think we’ll have capability by the end of the decade.”\nBut NGAD could also be the most expensive aircraft program in history. Kendall told lawmakers in April each piloted aircraft under the program would likely cost several hundred million dollars apiece.\nThe Air Force asked Congress for almost $1.7 billion for NGAD in its fiscal 2023 budget, including $133 million in research, development, testing and evaluation funding.\nKendall also indicated in his remarks Wednesday he wants the Air Force’s acquisition programs to more quickly move to production. Too often, he said, it takes years to reach that stage, and he’s instructed the Air Force to set up programs in a way that get meaningful capabilities to airmen as soon as possible.\n“I’m not interested in demos and experiments unless they are a necessary step on the road to real capability,” Kendall said. “What we tend to do is do a quick demo, and then we have to start an EMD or development program and wait several more years, because we didn’t start the developmental function. If we don’t need it to reduce risk, we should go right to development for production and get there as quickly as we can.”\nAnd, he said, he has such a “sense of urgency” about the need to get cutting-edge capabilities, like the uncrewed combat aircraft accompanying manned aircraft, into the field that he’s willing to accept more risk.\n",

        "原文": "NIST scientist Gary Zabow had never intended to use candy in his lab. It was only as a last resort that he had even tried burying microscopic magnetic dots in hardened chunks of sugar — hard candy, basically — and sending these sweet packages to colleagues in a biomedical lab. The sugar dissolves easily in water, freeing the magnetic dots for their studies without leaving any harmful plastics or chemicals behind.\nBy chance, Zabow had left one of these sugar pieces, embedded with arrays of micromagnetic dots, in a beaker, and it did what sugar does with time and heat — it melted, coating the bottom of the beaker in a gooey mess.\n“No problem,” he thought. He would just dissolve away the sugar, as normal. Except this time when he rinsed out the beaker, the microdots were gone. But they weren’t really missing; instead of releasing into the water, they had been transferred onto the bottom of the glass where they were casting a rainbow reflection.\n“It was those rainbow colors that really surprised me,” Zabow recalls. The colors indicated that the arrays of microdots had retained their unique pattern.\nThis sweet mess gave him an idea. Could regular table sugar be used to bring the power of microchips to new and unconventional surfaces? Zabow’s findings on this potential transfer printing process were published in Science in its Nov. 25 issue.\nSemiconductor chips, micropatterned surfaces, and electronics all rely on microprinting, the process of putting precise but minuscule patterns millionths to billionths of a meter wide onto surfaces to give them new properties. Traditionally, these tiny mazes of metals and other materials are printed on flat wafers of silicon. But as the possibilities for semiconductor chips and smart materials expand, these intricate, tiny patterns need to be printed on new, unconventional, non-flat surfaces.\nDirectly printing these patterns on such surfaces is tricky, so scientists transfer prints. There are flexible tapes and plastics that can do the job (like using putty to pick up newsprint), but these solids can still have trouble conforming to sharp curves and corners when the print is laid back down. They could also leave behind plastics or other chemicals that could be hard to remove or be unsafe for biomedical uses.\nAn optical micrograph showing 1-micron-wide disks transferred onto the sharp tip of a pin, shown in the inset image.\nThe REFLEX process transferred 1-micron disk arrays onto the sharp point of a pin.\nCredit: G. Zabow/NIST\nThere are liquid techniques, where the transfer material is floated on the surface of water and the target surface is pushed through it. But that can be tricky too; with a freely flowing liquid it can be hard to place the print precisely where you want it on a new surface.\nBut, as Zabow discovered to his surprise, a simple combination of caramelized sugar and corn syrup can do the trick.\nWhen dissolved in a small amount of water, this sugar mixture can be poured over micropatterns on a flat surface. Once the water evaporates, the candy hardens and can be lifted away with the pattern embedded. The candy with the print is then placed over the new surface and melted. The sugar/corn syrup combination maintains a high viscosity as it melts, letting the pattern maintain its arrangement as it flows over curves and edges. Then, using water, the sugar can be washed away, leaving just the pattern behind.\nUsing this technique, called REFLEX (REflow-driven FLExible Xfer), microcircuit patterns could be transferred like a stencil to allow scientists or manufacturers to etch and fill the materials they need in the right places. Or, patterned materials could be transferred from their original chip onto fibers or microbeads for potential biomedical or microrobotics studies, or over sharp or curved surfaces within new devices.\nThe technique proved successful for a large range of surfaces, including printing onto the sharp point of a pin, and writing the word “NIST” in microscale gold lettering onto a single strand of human hair. In another example, 1-micrometer-diameter magnetic disks were successfully transferred onto a floss fiber of a milkweed seed. In the presence of a magnet, the magnetically printed fiber reacted, showing the transfer had worked.\nThere’s still more to explore with REFLEX, but this process could open new possibilities for new materials and microstructures across fields from electronics to optics to biomedical engineering.\n“The semiconductor industry has spent billions of dollars perfecting the printing techniques to create chips we rely on,” Zabow says. “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could leverage some of those technologies, expanding the reach of those prints with something as simple and inexpensive as a piece of candy?”\n",

The Pentagon’s Space Development Agency will use the data to develop thermal sensors that can detect hypersonic missiles and other advanced weapons while in flight.\nCygnus NG-16 will fly on a Northrop Grumman Antares rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS on Aug. 12.\nThe infrared imaging payload — called PIRPL (short for prototype infrared payload) — is a 110-pound multispectral camera also made by Northrop Grumman under a $13.8 million contract from the Space Development Agency (SDA) and the Missile Defense Agency.\nThis is SDA’s first experiment in support of its Tracking Layer, a planned constellation of small sensor satellites in low Earth orbit.\n“Upon arrival at the Space Station, PIRPL will begin collecting infrared data and expanding detection capabilities that will aid in the development of algorithms for the next generation of tracking satellites,” Northrop Grumman said Aug. 9 in a news release.\nPIRPL will gather imagery through the entire NG-16 mission expected to last about three months. After Cygnus leaves the space station, PIRPL will be released from the spacecraft and briefly operate in free flying mode so it can collect more data from different angles before it burns up in the atmosphere, an SDA official said during a call with reporters.\nThe imagery “will help us understand what Earth infrared backgrounds look like from this type of orbit,” the SDA official said.\nCurrent U.S. military missile-warning satellites have powerful infrared sensors that can detect ballistic missile launches from geosynchronous orbits 22,000 miles above Earth. SDA’s Tracking Layer satellites will be in lower orbits at about 600 miles so the agency needs sample data to develop algorithms that can identify targets amid the clutter.\n“One of the objectives is to look at what we can do from LEO orbits which are fairly new for these types of missions,” the official said. “We need to understand what the atmosphere, clouds, earth surface, land and ocean all look like at various times of day and night.”\nSDA and the Missile Defense Agency want to “show that we can do those missions at a lower Earth orbit, that we are able to get much closer to the threats,” the agency official said. Another reason for the PIRPL experiment is to test how sensors perform when they’re moving at very fast speeds in low orbits, compared to current staring sensors on geostationary satellites.\n“We call that a complex background,” the SDA official said of low Earth orbit. “We need to check whether LEO data can be processed successfully to do the same missions that we do well in high orbit.”\n",

It’s one of the first of its kind in the country and could lead the way for widespread adoption by the services in areas such as medical and maintenance training, according to company executives.\nAfter working in haptic and virtual reality technology for decades, Waymon Armstrong, CEO and president of the firm, said the technology has come a long way. If a soldier or a battlefield medic wearing a haptic-enabled glove can feel what it is like to pull a trigger or flip a switch, they are more likely to do their job correctly.\n“You put the gloves on and it just amplifies that,” he said. “It’s a force multiplier in making it seem so much more real.”\nWith sensory capabilities available in gloves, Marines can train in many more scenarios, Armstrong said. In September, the Marine Corps awarded Engineering and Computer Simulations — along with six other companies — indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts with an estimated value of up to $238 million.\nThe Marines Corps also is incorporating haptic technology into its advanced training Force-on-Force Training Systems-Next, which will feature a haptic wristwatch that will alert the user if direct or indirect fire is headed their way. Saab was awarded the contract for the system this summer.\nThe Army is also thinking about how to integrate the technology. The Orlando lab’s first research-and-development program is funded by the Army’s Simulation and Training Technology Center. Through 2024, researchers will study how the service could benefit from three different gloves, including HaptX’s DK2 gloves.\nThe DK2 — which launched in January — uses microfluidic technology to displace the skin on the user’s hand up to 2 millimeters, said Joe Michaels, chief revenue officer of HaptX. Compressed air flows through the glove to move 133 actuators against the palm to make it feel like a simulated object is actually pressing against it.\nThe glove also has tendons that can deliver 40 pounds of resistive force to give the virtual objects shape and a solid feel, he said.\n“Even if it’s just virtual in a 3D space, we can move your skin the way it’s moved when you’re touching a real object,” Michaels said.\nBut the realistic feel is not as useful unless it incorporates precise tracking, he noted. Leveraging electromagnetic sensors in every finger, the DK2 is accurate to the submillimeter in its finger tracking.\n“If you want to teach a pilot where his or her finger needs to go on a virtual panel, you need to know with submillimeter precision exactly where that virtual switch is located and where the finger is located,” he said.\n“A fighter pilot when there’s an emergency situation can’t open a training manual,” he added. “Their hands need to fly to the correct location and flip the correct switch without thinking about it.”\nAdditionally, if the gloves are adapted for maintenance training, they could save the military money in avoiding costly repair errors, Michaels noted.\nArmstrong said young warfighters are already accustomed to the haptic technology used in video games such as vibrating controllers, which would make the transition to using the sensory training intuitive.\nMichaels has watched the fervor for haptics spread since HaptX — which is based in San Luis Obispo, California — launched nine years ago.\nThe company has raised $31 million in investments during that time, but it didn’t always aim to make tech for the military, he said.\n“We’ve seen this fortunate confluence of interests, where we want to create the world’s most realistic haptic technologies, and the government is starting to understand that they need those to avoid negative training,” he said. Negative training occurs when trainees receive such poor instruction that it has to be retaught.\nHaptX has worked with the Army, Navy and Air Force in addition to the Department of Energy and Defense Intelligence Agency, Michaels said.\nHowever, the company has run into many of the same problems as other firms have when trying to work with the government.\n“It’s not easy to get the government to move as one,” he said. “You try to work in achievable steps and show the promise of realistic haptics in individual instances and prove it out.”\nOne challenge is there is no one-size-fits-all product that will work with every military program, he said. Additionally, the glove would have to work with different virtual reality technology ranging from high-end to low-end systems.\nHowever, progress is being made with haptic technology. One reason for that has been the decreasing cost of the products, Armstrong noted.\n“When we started, the envelope cost was in the six figures,” he said. “Now it’s in the low four figures, going up to five figures, and that keeps coming down.”\nMichaels declined to reveal the cost of the HaptX glove, but said the price is still “more cost effective than what happens when something goes terribly wrong in a live training.”\nThe advancements industry has made with haptic capabilities have been bolstered by military funding, said Neal Finkelstein, chief operating officer of the National Center for Simulation. Many companies that NCS works with received seed funding from Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, or STTR, programs. With the funding comes more specific feedback to the companies about what capabilities the services need, which improves the quality of the products, he said.\n“They’re just building on improving them every year,” he said.\nFor example, HaptX wouldn’t have been able to scale up and enter a “bigger growth path” without funding from the STTR program, Michaels noted.\n“They saw the potential, even before it was a mature technology,” he said. “It’s critical for a hardware company to find that kind of support.”\nHowever, glove technology faces a logistics challenge that makes it hard to scale for the military, Armstrong said. A snug fit makes the systems more effective, but that is hard to achieve because everyone has a different sized hand. Most gloves on the market are billed as one-size-fits-all, he said.\n“The technology is going to be there, it’s just getting it where people are feeling comfortable that it’s my hand, and that’s how I hold it,” he said.\nMeanwhile, the Engineering and Computer Simulations lab is looking at new technology that will engage a trainee’s sense of smell to improve training, Armstrong said.\n“There’s a smell associated with blood. There’s a smell associated with gunfire,” he said. “It just amplifies the reality that you really believe you’re there. ... It’s going to help you focus acuity-wise not just cognitively on the decision making, [but also] that muscle memory.”\nHowever, taking that capability public has been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, he noted.\nThe lab plans to stage demonstrations in November during the National Training and Simulation Association’s annual Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference in Orlando.\nBesides military customers, there is potential for first responders and police to take advantage of haptic technology in their training regimes, Armstrong said.\nMedical training is another area of interest for haptic technology, said Finkelstein. As the military moves away from practicing on animals in casualty care training, service members still should be able to realistically practice how to perform first aid or tie a tourniquet on the battlefield.\n“You don’t want to be cutting too deep, and you don’t want to be turning things too tight,” he said of medical procedures. “You’ve got to feel that, and the way to do that is with ... haptics feedback.” (For more on military medical training, see story on page 35)\nMeanwhile, haptics have advanced to the point where the military could potentially incorporate them beyond training.\nFor example, HaptX is developing a prototype of its glove that will allow users to control robotic hands. The robotic hand would send data to the haptic glove, enabling the operator to feel what it feels. This enables “incredible precision” for robotic control, which can be useful in mission critical environments, Michaels said.\nA viral video of former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos stacking cups using large robotic arms was a collaboration between HaptX and companies Shadow Robot and SynTouch.\n“It felt like this moment was going to be big for us, and in fact, it was because everyone has seen Jeff Bezos using haptics gloves,” he said. “It tells the story for us.”\nAnother company, L3Harris, has its own variation of the technology that it has incorporated into its unmanned ground vehicle systems portfolio. The Air Force awarded the company $85 million over 10 years to deliver up to 170 of its T7 robots, which will be used to dispose of dangerous explosives, according to a company news release. Initial delivery is expected in 2022.\nThe robot offers users safe standoff distance between themselves and potentially hazardous materials, said Paul Bosscher, chief engineer and senior scientist at the company’s robotics division.\nSometimes it can be difficult to see what the robot is doing from long distances, even with cameras, he noted. That’s where haptic technology comes in. The feedback in the remote control allows users to feel what the robot feels. That sensation combined with the camera views make the system easy to operate, he said.\nBecause of the sensory feedback in the glove, training to use the arm itself takes about three to five days, Bosscher added.\n“The training benefit to our customers is really paying off because these operators are getting up to speed on the equipment very quickly,” he said. “There’s a high rate of skills retention and they don’t forget how to use the system.”\nHe added: “You get fewer mistakes during missions, and fewer mistakes with a bomb is a good thing.”\n",

In the era of COVID-19, this would include medical supplies but also items critical to the electrical grid and national security.\n“The COVID-19 pandemic and semiconductor shortages exposed that critical United States supply chains were not up to the task of robustly responding to America’s needs,” DeLauro said. “We have to learn from our mistakes and cannot allow outbound investments from the United States to take critical supply chains overseas and into the hands of our adversaries such as China or Russia. Companies at a minimum should be required to report on their proposed offshoring of supply chains so the United States can better protect critical manufacturing capacity here at home and safeguard American workers and our national, economic, and health security.”\nIn addition to the NCCC, which would be composed of representatives from various federal agencies, the legislation would also establish coordination between such federal agencies and empower the President to take action and shut down any national security risks associated with a supply chain transaction. A rulemaking process would also be launched to add relevant industries to the NCCC’s oversight as needed, while Federal Acquisition Regulation would be revised to alter request for proposals to request firms disclose both sourcing and supply chains contractors would use, an estimate of their impact on U.S. jobs and any reliance on foreign-made materials.\n",

        "源标题": "A step toward producing solar fuels out of thin air",
        "原文": "A device that can harvest water from the air and provide hydrogen fuel—entirely powered by solar energy—has been a dream for researchers for decades. Now, EPFL chemical engineer Kevin Sivula and his team have made a significant step toward bringing this vision closer to reality. They have developed an ingenious yet simple system that combines semiconductor-based technology with novel electrodes that have two key characteristics: they are porous, to maximize contact with water in the air; and transparent, to maximize sunlight exposure of the semiconductor coating. When the device is simply exposed to sunlight, it takes water from the air and produces hydrogen gas. The results have been published on 4 January 2023 in Advanced Materials.\n\"To realize a sustainable society, we need ways to store renewable energy as chemicals that can be used as fuels and feedstocks in industry. Solar energy is the most abundant form of renewable energy, and we are striving to develop economically competitive ways to produce solar fuels,\" says Sivula of EPFL's Laboratory for Molecular Engineering of Optoelectronic Nanomaterials and principal investigator of the study.\nInspiration from a plant's leaf\nIn their research for renewable fossil-free fuels, the EPFL engineers in collaboration with Toyota Motor Europe, took inspiration from the way plants are able to convert sunlight into chemical energy using carbon dioxide from the air. A plant essentially harvests carbon dioxide and water from its environment, and with the extra boost of energy from sunlight, can transform these molecules into sugars and starches, a process known as photosynthesis. The sunlight's energy is stored in the form of chemical bonds inside of the sugars and starches.\nThe transparent gas diffusion electrodes developed by Sivula and his team, when coated with a light harvesting semiconductor material, indeed act like an artificial leaf, harvesting water from the air and sunlight to produce hydrogen gas. The sunlight's energy is stored in the form of hydrogen bonds.\nInstead of building electrodes with traditional layers that are opaque to sunlight, their substrate is actually a 3-dimensional mesh of felted glass fibers.\nMarina Caretti, lead author of the work, says, \"Developing our prototype device was challenging since transparent gas-diffusion electrodes have not been previously demonstrated, and we had to develop new procedures for each step. However, since each step is relatively simple and scalable, I think that our approach will open new horizons for a wide range of applications starting from gas diffusion substrates for solar-driven hydrogen production.\"\nFrom liquid water to humidity in the air\nSivula and other research groups have previously shown that it is possible to perform artificial photosynthesis by generating hydrogen fuel from liquid water and sunlight using a device called a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. A PEC cell is generally known as a device that uses incident light to stimulate a photosensitive material, like a semiconductor, immersed in liquid solution to cause a chemical reaction. But for practical purposes, this process has its disadvantages; e.g., it is complicated to make large-area PEC devices that use liquid.\nSivula wanted to show that the PEC technology can be adapted for harvesting humidity from the air instead, leading to the development of their new gas diffusion electrode. Electrochemical cells (e.g., fuel cells) have already been shown to work with gases instead of liquids, but the gas diffusion electrodes used previously are opaque and incompatible with the solar-powered PEC technology.\nNow, the researchers are focusing their efforts into optimizing the system. What is the ideal fiber size? The ideal pore size? The ideal semiconductors and membrane materials? These are questions that are being pursued in the EU Project Sun-to-X, which is dedicated to advance this technology, and develop new ways to convert hydrogen into liquid fuels.\nMaking transparent, gas-diffusion electrodes\nIn order to make transparent gas diffusion electrodes, the researchers start with a type of glass wool, which is essentially quartz (also known as silicon oxide) fibers and process it into felt wafers by fusing the fibers together at high temperature. Next, the wafer is coated with a transparent thin film of fluorine-doped tin oxide, known for its excellent conductivity, robustness and ease to scale-up.\nThese first steps result in a transparent, porous, and conducting wafer, essential for maximizing contact with the water molecules in the air and letting photons through. The wafer is then coated again, this time with a thin-film of sunlight-absorbing semiconductor materials. This second thin coating still lets light through, but appears opaque due to the large surface area of the porous substrate. As is, this coated wafer can already produce hydrogen fuel once exposed to sunlight.\nThe scientists went on to build a small chamber containing the coated wafer, as well as a membrane for separating the produced hydrogen gas for measurement.

        "中文原文": "一种可以从空气中收集水并提供氢燃料的设备--完全由太阳能供电--几十年来一直是研究人员的梦想。现在，EPFL化学工程师Kevin Sivula和他的团队朝着实现这一愿景迈出了重要的一步。他们开发了一种巧妙而简单的系统，将基于半导体的技术与新颖的电极结合起来，这些电极具有两个关键特征：它们是多孔的，可以最大限度地与空气中的水接触；并且透明，使半导体涂层的日光曝光量最大化。当该装置简单地暴露在阳光下时，它从空气中吸取水并产生氢气。该结果已于2023年1月4日发表在《先进材料》上。“为了实现一个可持续的社会，我们需要将可再生能源储存为化学物质的方法，这些化学物质可以在工业中用作燃料和原料。EPFL光电纳米材料分子工程实验室的Sivula是这项研究的主要研究员，他说：”太阳能是最丰富的可再生能源形式，我们正在努力开发经济上有竞争力的方法来生产太阳能燃料。“植物叶子的灵感在他们对可再生的无化石燃料的研究中，EPFL的工程师与丰田汽车欧洲公司合作，从植物利用空气中的二氧化碳将阳光转化为化学能的方式中获得灵感。植物主要从环境中收集二氧化碳和水，在阳光的额外能量推动下，可以将这些分子转化为糖和淀粉，这一过程被称为光合作用。阳光的能量以化学键的形式储存在糖类和淀粉中。Sivula和他的团队开发的透明气体扩散电极，当涂上一层光收集半导体材料时，确实像一片人造叶子，从空气和阳光中收集水，以产生氢气。太阳光的能量以氢键的形式储存。而不是用传统的对阳光不透明的层来构建电极，它们的基底实际上是一个三维的毡合玻璃纤维网。这项工作的主要作者玛丽娜·卡雷蒂（Marina Caretti）表示：“开发我们的原型设备具有挑战性，因为透明的气体扩散电极以前没有被展示过，我们必须为每一步开发新的程序。然而，由于每一步都相对简单和可扩展，我认为我们的方法将为从太阳能驱动的制氢气体扩散基底开始的广泛应用打开新的视野。”从液态水到空气中的湿度Sivula和其他研究小组此前已经表明，通过使用一种称为光电化学(PEC)电池的设备，从液态水和阳光中生成氢燃料来进行人工光合作用是可能的。PEC电池通常被称为一种设备，它使用入射光刺激浸入液体溶液中的感光材料，如半导体，以引起化学反应。但就实际目的而言，这一过程有其缺点；例如，制造使用液体的大面积PEC器件是复杂的。Sivula希望表明PEC技术可以用于从空气中收集湿度，从而开发出新的气体扩散电极。电化学电池（例如燃料电池）已经被证明可以使用气体而不是液体，但以前使用的气体扩散电极是不透明的，与太阳能PEC技术不兼容。现在，研究人员正集中精力优化该系统。理想的纤维尺寸是多少？理想的孔径？理想的半导体和膜材料？这些都是欧盟项目Sun-to-X正在研究的问题，该项目致力于推进这项技术，并开发将氢转化为液体燃料的新方法。制造透明的气体扩散电极为了制造透明的气体扩散电极，研究人员从一种玻璃棉开始，这种玻璃棉本质上是石英（也称为氧化硅）纤维，通过在高温下将纤维熔合在一起，将其加工成毡片。接下来，晶片被涂覆一层透明的掺氟氧化锡薄膜，该薄膜以其优异的导电性、鲁棒性和易于放大而闻名。这些第一步产生了一个透明、多孔和导电的晶片，这是最大限度地与空气中的水分子接触并让光子通过的关键。然后，晶圆被再次涂覆，这一次是一层吸收阳光的半导体材料薄膜。第二层薄薄的涂层仍然让光线通过，但由于多孔基底的大表面积而显得不透明。事实上，这种涂层晶片一旦暴露在阳光下，就已经可以生产氢燃料。科学家们接着建造了一个小房间，里面装着涂层",

        "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland have developed a new transparent electrode that can use moisture in the air and solar energy to produce hydrogen fuel. The electrode is a clever and simple system, which is porous and can contact with moisture in the air to the maximum extent. The electrode is transparent and can be exposed to sunlight to the maximum extent. When exposed to sunlight, it absorbs moisture from the air and produces hydrogen. Different from the traditional opaque electrode, the new electrode substrate consists of felt glass fibers with three-dimensional grid. In order to manufacture transparent gas diffusion electrodes, the researchers fused silicon oxide together at high temperature to make felt wafers, and then coated a transparent film of fluorine-doped tin oxide for absorbing sunlight energy on the wafers. The film coating can allow light to pass through, but it is opaque due to the large surface area of the porous substrate. In fact, once exposed to sunlight, this coated wafer can produce hydrogen fuel. Experimental tests show that the maximum solar-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the coated wafer is as high as 12%. The research results are expected to accelerate the development and application of hydrogen energy technology."

It confirms:\n? Current UK regulators of fusion R&D facilities will retain responsibility for fusion. This means future fusion facilities will continue to be regulated by the EA and HSE (or devolved bodies as appropriate).\n? This regulatory approach will apply to all planned fusion prototype energy facilities in the UK. This provides clarity to developers of prototype / demonstration fusion facilities currently being planned to support rapid commercialisation.\n? The government will legislate to make clear in law the regulatory treatment of fusion energy. This provides certainty and confidence to the industry by amending the law to exclude fusion energy facilities from nuclear regulatory and licensing requirements.\nGeorge Freeman, Science Minister, said: “Input from UK and international experts has been invaluable in helping the government to reach a decision on how to regulate this rapidly evolving, cutting-edge technology. We remain confident that existing regulations in the UK will be able to uphold safety standards in a proportionate way.\n“We believe that the decisions – based on the best available evidence and now supported by regulators, the fusion industry and other experts – are the right ones to help move safely and determinedly towards fusion energy.”\nProf. Ian Chapman, UKAEA Chief Executive, added: “This early confirmation of a proportionate regulatory framework will help accelerate the progress of fusion energy, which has great potential to deliver safe, sustainable, low carbon energy for generations to come. It demonstrates our government’s high-level support and progressive approach to enabling fusion to happen here in the UK.\n“Our work continues to create jobs and drive economic growth while placing the UK at the forefront of the international scientific community. This national capability and new regulatory framework is also helping to attract overseas investment, giving us the very best opportunity to become a global exporter of fusion technology.”\nThe government’s proposals consider the assessment of the hazard of fusion energy facilities, and the significant difference to nuclear fission power plants. It is now putting in place a programme of work to develop areas of the regulatory framework.\nThe UK’s Fusion Strategy set out how the UK aims to support the development of fusion energy – based on the same processes that power the sun and stars – for commercial industrial use over the next two decades.\nIn December 2021 the Joint European Torus – the most powerful fusion facility in the world and operated by UKAEA in Culham, Oxford – broke its own record for sustained fusion energy. JET has been successfully regulated by the Environment Agency and the HSE during its 39-year lifetime.\nBy the end of 2021 the global private fusion sector had raised over $4bn, a $2bn increase on 2020. Today’s confirmation of a regulatory regime by the UK government will provide further certainty to investors in fusion in the UK.\n",

        "原文": "By Jason Sherman\nNovember 19, 2021 at 7:50 PM\nThe Missile Defense Agency has tapped three companies to advance their respective concept designs for a Glide Phase Interceptor, setting up a three-way contest between Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman for a new Aegis guided missile optimized to defeat a new class of ultra-fast maneuvering weapons and give the Navy a second layer of defense against hypersonic threats.\nNearly five years after MDA was directed by Congress to create a hypersonic defense program, the agencytoday announced the milestone development, awarding Lockheed Martin and Raytheon $20 million contracts each and Northrop Grumman $18.5 million to complete accelerated GPI concept designs.\n\"We are pleased to have these contractors working with us to develop design concepts for the GPI,\" Rear Adm. Tom Druggan, MDA's sea-based weapon systems program executive said in a statement. \"Multiple awards allow us to execute a risk reduction phase to explore industry concepts and maximize the benefits of a competitive environment to demonstrate the most effective and reliable Glide Phase Interceptor for regional hypersonic defense, as soon as possible.\"\nThe firm-fixed-price other transaction prototype awards are part of an effort to mature high-risk areas in an effort to assess the viability of a particular concept's unique design characteristics. MDA has $127.3 million in FY-21 funds allocated for GPI development and is seeking $135.8 million for the new interceptor in FY-22.\nGPI is intended to be a second layer of defense against hypersonic threats, building on the currently fielded Standard Missile-6 interceptor used for terminal defense. GPI would engage maneuvering glide vehicles during its \"regional\" phase -- a distance akin to midcourse engagement but inside the atmosphere against a non-ballistic target.\nToday’s contract awards mark a pivot from MDA’s focus on technical risk-reduction and concept development efforts for GPI, and caps three years of study and analysis on how best to counter a new class of ultrafast weapons being fielded by Russia and China to maneuver around current U.S. air and ballistic missile defenses.\nEach of the companies must design a weapon to be compatible with the Aegis ballistic missile defense-capable destroyers using the standard vertical launch system; MDA said in a statement the new GPI must also integrate with the modified Baseline 9 Aegis Weapon System -- the most advanced variant fielded -- to detect, track, control, and engage hypersonic threats in the glide phase of the missile's flight.\n\"MDA realizes warfighting capability enabled by hypersonic systems will require that the program concurrently develop the time-critical targeting and command, control and communications capabilities that complete the fire control loop necessary for effective employment of the hypersonic systems,” MDA Spokesman Mark Wright toldInside Defense. “The initial phase of the GPI concept is expected to be demonstrated and, if funded, continue to be developed in an accelerated environment producing an operational prototype.”\nBecause of their speed -- hypersonic weapons travel at least one mile per second -- their maneuverability and altitude, these ultra-fast systems promise military utility that includes the ability to penetrate even the most sophisticated air and missile defense systems.\n“The initial phase, which goes through demonstration in the late 2020s, allows MDA to focus efforts on design and demonstration of the GPI concept for a near-term hypersonic defense capability while maturing the necessary technology needed to increase the battlespace for defending against hypersonic threats,” Wright added. “Future phases, if funded, will mature the concept from there.\"\nThe Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, enacted Dec. 23, 2016, directed MDA to establish a hypersonic defense program of record, focusing on hypersonic boost-glide vehicles designed to maneuver inside the atmosphere for most of their flight paths, generating a distinctly non-ballistic trajectory.\n",

The lab earlier this year awarded SpaceX a$102 million five-year contractto demonstrate technologies and capabilities totransport military cargoand humanitarian aid around the world on a heavy rocket. But AFRL has yet to announce any planned demonstration.\nThe first CRADA was signed withSpaceXin March 2020, and the Air Force in June 2021 designated rocket cargo as one of its“vanguard” programs. Enthusiasm for the program grew after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk unveiled theStarship megarocketdesigned to carry humans to the moon and Mars but also possibly for point-to-point transportation on Earth. The vehicle is still?undergoing testingand has not yet flown an orbital mission.\n“Based on advertised commercial capability and business objectives, the Air Force Research Laboratory is currently assessing emerging rocket capability across the commercial vendor base, and its potential use for quickly transporting DOD materiel to ports across the globe,” AFRL said.\nVan Ovost said space transportation would be a fundamental shift in the way DoD could respond to contingencies and disasters, adding a new tool to existing air, land and sea delivery.\n“This is a very exciting area,” she said. “We signed five CRADAs because each of these companies are taking essentially a different approach at how they might do point to point, so we have something to learn from each of these different companies.”\nThe agreement with Rocket Lab, for example, will explore using the company’s Photon spacecraft to establish on-orbit cargo depots and provide re-entry capability.\nVan Ovost said it’s important for TRANSCOM to be included and to shape concepts for cargo and passenger transportation, “whether it’s something that’s going to stay in space for a while and deorbit or something that’s really going to go point to point.”\nA key goal is to understand “the art of the possible” and what each company would need to do to carry out a mission. “In the end, we have to make a decision not just based on how fast something can launch, but it’s the entire chain. What kind of packaging? How do I get it to a location? And how is it loaded and unloaded at the end?”\n",

It has a high-capacity magazine and fully adjustable stock that make it a multi-functional system in a single weapon, suitable for many different circumstances. A high level of configurability make the TRG M10 an extremely versatile platform: it easily converts from a true long-range precision rifle to a more compact piece of equipment. The maximum operating range is up to 1,500 meters, but the proven effective range is up to 1,200 meters.\nFully adjustable rear stock: all adjustments can be done quickly without the use of any tools. The stock can also be securely locked down when required by using tools that come inside the weapon. The pistol grip has an interchangeable back strap in three different sizes; all three are included in the standard package. Tactile indicators: identification of modular components for different calibers can be done visually or from tactile indicators placed on each critical component. Ambidextrous controls: the ambidextrous controls are well within the reach of the firing hand and are large enough to be also operated with gloves on. The robust and fully adjustable trigger unit can be detached for maintenance and adjustment without further disassembling the weapon.\nSaco TRG M10 is considered an evolution in the design of sniper rifles and was officially unveiled more than ten years ago, in October 2011. One of the impressive key features is the ability of the sniper rifle to switch from one to the second caliber: between .308 Winchester [7.62 × 51mm NATO], .300 Winchester Magnum, and .338 Lapua Magnum chamberings by changing the bolts: the TRG M10 has indicators that help identify different modular components for different calibers, where each caliber-depending component is specially marked so users can recognize the caliber of each part visually or by touch. To completely switch from one caliber to another, the shooter still has to change magazines, forends, and barrels.\n",

        "原文": "ByAlex Parrish\n9FEB022\nEdward Barron, Michael Bartlett, and Dohgyu Hwang hold a piece of material that has been warped. Photo by Alex Parrish for Virginia Tech.\nImagine a small autonomous vehicle that could drive over land, stop, and flatten itself into a quadcopter. The rotors start spinning, and the vehicle flies away. Looking at it more closely, what do you think you would see? What mechanisms have caused it to morph from a land vehicle into a flying quadcopter? You might imagine gears and belts, perhaps a series of tiny servo motors that pulled all its pieces into place.\nIf this mechanism was designed by a team at Virginia Tech led byMichael Bartlett, assistant professor in mechanical engineering, you would see a new approach for shape changing at the material level. These researchers use rubber, metal, and temperature to morph materials and fix them into place with no motors or pulleys. The team’s work has been published inScience Robotics. Co-authors of the paper include graduate students Dohgyu Hwang and Edward J. Barron III and postdoctoral researcher A. B. M. Tahidul Haque.\nGetting into shape\nNature is rich with organisms that change shape to perform different functions. The octopus dramatically reshapes to move, eat, and interact with its environment; humans flex muscles to support loads and hold shape; and plants move to capture sunlight throughout the day. How do you create a material that achieves these functions to enable new types of multifunctional, morphing robots?\n“When we started the project, we wanted a material that could do three things: change shape, hold that shape, and then return to the original configuration, and to do this over many cycles,” said Bartlett. “One of the challenges was to create a material that was soft enough to dramatically change shape, yet rigid enough to create adaptable machines that can perform different functions.”\nTo create a structure that could be morphed, the team turned to kirigami, the Japanese art of making shapes out of paper by cutting. This method differs from origami, which uses folding. By observing the strength of those kirigami patterns in rubbers and composites, the team was able to create a material architecture of a repeating geometric pattern.\nNext, they needed a material that would hold shape but allow for that shape to be erased on demand. Here they introduced an endoskeleton made of a low melting point alloy (LMPA) embedded inside a rubber skin. Normally, when a metal is stretched too far, the metal becomes permanently bent, cracked, or stretched into a fixed, unusable shape. However, with this special metal embedded in rubber, the researchers turned this typical failure mechanism into a strength. When stretched, this composite would now hold a desired shape rapidly, perfect for soft morphing materials that can become instantly load bearing.\nFinally, the material had to return the structure back to its original shape. Here, the team incorporated soft, tendril-like heaters next to the LMPA mesh. The heaters cause the metal to be converted to a liquid at 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), or 10 percent of the melting temperature of aluminum. The elastomer skin keeps the melted metal contained and in place, and then pulls the material back into the original shape, reversing the stretching, giving the composite what the researchers call \"reversible plasticity.\" After the metal cools, it again contributes to holding the structure’s shape.\nAbove: a section of morphed material is returned to its original state.\n“These composites have a metal endoskeleton embedded into a rubber with soft heaters, where the kirigami-inspired cuts define an array of metal beams. These cuts combined with the unique properties of the materials were really important to morph, fix into shape rapidly, then return to the original shape,” Hwang said.\nThe researchers found that this kirigami-inspired composite design could create complex shapes, from cylinders to balls to the bumpy shape of the bottom of a pepper. Shape change could also be achieved quickly: After impact with a ball, the shape changed and fixed into place in less than 1/10 of a second. Also, if the material broke, it could be healed multiple times by melting and reforming the metal endoskeleton.\nOne drone for land and air, one for sea\nThe applications for this technology are only starting to unfold. By combining this material with onboard power, control, and motors, the team created a functional drone that autonomously morphs from a ground to air vehicle. The team also created a small, deployable submarine, using the morphing and returning of the material to retrieve objects from an aquarium by scraping the belly of the sub along the bottom.\n“We’re excited about the opportunities this material presents for multifunctional robots. These composites are strong enough to withstand the forces from motors or propulsion systems, yet can readily shape morph, which allows machines to adapt to their environment,” said Barron.\nLooking forward, the researchers envision the morphing composites playing a role in the emerging field of soft robotics to create machines that can perform diverse functions, self-heal after being damaged to increase resilience, and spur different ideas in human-machine interfaces and wearable devices.\nThis project was funded through Bartlett’s DARPAYoung Faculty Awardand Director’s Fellowship.\n",

Through the combination of the paper-cut structure notch and the unique characteristics of the material, the rapid deformation and fixation of the structure shape can be realized (within 0.1 second), and then the reduction and fixation of the structure shape can be realized by heating the material to 60 ℃ and cooling, while eliminating the power requirement for maintaining the shape.The researchers successfully demonstrated the material structure, and by integrating it with airborne power supply, motor and controller, they created a soft robot that can be automatically converted from a small ground vehicle to an unmanned aerial vehicle, and a small deployable submarine robot that can collect underwater objects."

Just some of the industries that stand to benefit from scalable quantum technology include machine learning, cryptography, chemistry and drug development, and communications processes.\nQuantum computing demands different hardware and software than its mainstream counterparts—and that requires significant investments. Per one estimate cited in the report, adequate government investment in quantum technology deployment could cost up to $10 billion.\nThe four key factors that will likely determine the development of quantum technology are the strength of the workforce and supply chain, the volume of funding, and collaboration across both different industries and countries.\nCollaborative efforts between academic, industry and government institutions are critical to developing breakthroughs with quantum computing, the report says, which should be spearheaded by a highly developed labor force trained to work in the quantum field.\n“The United States needs to develop a strong quantum workforce in order to maintain its leadership position in quantum technology hardware and software development,” the report writes.\nFunding is key to both collaboration and talent development, which can address gaps in the U.S. education system to include a quantum technology curriculum, and keep uncertain and long-term development timeframes operational. Energy Department laboratory officials told the GAO that funding is particularly important for initial research and development to gauge project durations. Without a timeline in place to better understand the long-term technological processes, funding could wane, one stakeholder said in the report.\nQuantum research also requires a resilient electronics supply chain. The report warns that outstanding risks and gaps in a global supply chain that provide the necessary materials for quantum technology can delay development.\n“Development and deployment of quantum technologies will be contingent on the ability to reliably produce novel quantum materials,” the report authors write, noting mining critical minerals for specific hardware applications could “pose risks” to developing basic quantum foundries. One solution the report offers is to fund facilities dedicated to supplying quantum input materials to keep the supply chain flowing.\nExperts also suggest that private industry involvement and funding is a factor that differentiates the U.S. from other countries that are investing in quantum.\n“The private sector is rarely investing in long term infrastructure,” Sridhar Tayur, the Ford Distinguished Research Chair of Operations Management at Carnegie Mellon University,toldNextgov. “I think that is where the government can help.” He specified that having policymakers establish a robust infrastructure, ranging from an updated satellite network to new laboratories for the quantum industry to grow, is crucial to a sustainable industry.\n“I think collaboration between the private sectors that can build the technology––assuming that there is infrastructure to work with … I think can be very helpful,” he said.\n",

        "原文": "Silicon carbide (SiC) unipolar semiconductors are in wide commercial use, but their operations are limited by a trade-off relationship between breakdown voltage and specific resistance of the drift layer, or specific on-resistance. Including a super junction structure, which refers to an arrangement of n and p layers in trenches in the drift layer, or enabling bipolar operation in the device provides a way to overcome this unipolar limit. Bipolar operation brings about a large decrease in on-resistance by inducing a conductivity modulation in the drift layer. But bipolar operation is not without its disadvantages. Conduction and switching losses in bipolar devices need to be carefully balanced.\nP-type contact layers in semiconductors are generally formed via aluminum (Al) doping. Al doping can be achieved in two ways—epitaxial or ion implantation. Epitaxial growth involves the layer by layer deposition of semiconductor materials on a substrate, whereas ion implantation entails bombarding the semiconductor layers with high energy charged particles. But ion implantation leads to the formation of defects deep in the semiconductor layers, which could have a critical effect on conductivity modulation.\nIn a recent study published in Physica Status Solidi (b), researchers from Japan investigated the depth distribution of defects in SiC bipolar diodes that were formed by Al doping. \"Our findings will help with the optimum design of SiC power devices, which will soon be employed in electric vehicles, trains etc. These results will ultimately help improve the performance, as well as the size and energy consumption of traction systems in vehicles and trains,\" says Associate Professor Dr. Masashi Kato of Nagoya Institute of Technology, who led the study.\nTo study the depth distribution of defects, the research team fabricated two SiC PiN diodes with Al doped p-layers, one through epitaxial growth and the other through ion implantation. They then studied the distribution of defects in both diodes using conventional 'deep level transient spectroscopy' (DLTS) and characterized its properties using cathodoluminescence (CL). They found that p-type layer deposition by epitaxial growth did not cause damage in the adjacent n-type layers, but that the growth showed slight instability that led to the formation of deep level defects. The specific on-resistance of this diode was also low, thanks to the effects of conductivity modulation.\nFor the diode formed by ion implantation, however, the researchers found that Al doping achieved a high specific on-resistance without influencing conductivity modulation. Moreover, the researchers observed that the defects in the semiconductor device penetrated to a minimum of 20 ?m from the implantation region. \"Our study shows that the ion implantation in SiC bipolar devices need to be processed at least 20 ?m away from the active regions,\" explains Dr. Kato.\nThe low power consumption of SiC power devices mean that they will be essential in the future as climate change increases and the fossil fuel energy crisis worsens. Improving semiconductor technology rapidly so that it can take its rightful place on the world stage is of paramount importance. With strong results like this to inform future research and manufacturing, we may realize this future sooner than expected!\n",

        "原文": "The quantum computing market is projected to reach $65 billion by 2030, a hot topic for investors and scientists alike because of its potential to solve incomprehensibly complex problems.\nDrug discovery is one example. To understand drug interactions, a pharmaceutical company might want to simulate the interaction of two molecules. The challenge is that each molecule is composed of a few hundred atoms, and scientists must model all the ways in which these atoms might array themselves when their respective molecules are introduced. The number of possible configurations is infinite—more than the number of atoms in the entire universe. Only a quantum computer can represent, much less solve, such an expansive, dynamic data problem.\nMainstream use of quantum computing remains decades away, while research teams in universities and private industry across the globe work on different dimensions of the technology.\nA research team led by Xu Yi, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science, has carved a niche in the physics and applications of photonic devices, which detect and shape light for a wide range of uses including communications and computing. His research group has created a scalable quantum computing platform, which drastically reduces the number of devices needed to achieve quantum speed, on a photonic chip the size of a penny.\nOlivier Pfister, professor of quantum optics and quantum information at UVA, and Hansuek Lee, assistant professor at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, contributed to this success.\nNature Communications recently published the team's experimental results, A Squeezed Quantum Microcomb on a Chip. Two of Yi's group members, Zijiao Yang, a Ph.D. student in physics, and Mandana Jahanbozorgi, a Ph.D. student of electrical and computer engineering, are the paper's co-first authors. A grant from the National Science Foundation's Engineering Quantum Integrated Platforms for Quantum Communication program supports this research.\nQuantum computing promises an entirely new way of processing information. Your desktop or laptop computer processes information in long strings of bits. A bit can hold only one of two values: zero or one. Quantum computers process information in parallel, which means they don't have to wait for one sequence of information to be processed before they can compute more. Their unit of information is called a qubit, a hybrid that can be one and zero at the same time. A quantum mode, or qumode, spans the full spectrum of variables between one and zero—the values to the right of the decimal point.\nResearchers are working on different approaches to efficiently produce the enormous number of qumodes needed to achieve quantum speeds.\nYi's photonics-based approach is attractive because a field of light is also full spectrum; each light wave in the spectrum has the potential to become a quantum unit. Yi hypothesized that by entangling fields of light, the light would achieve a quantum state.\nYou are likely familiar with the optical fibers that deliver information through the internet. Within each optical fiber, lasers of many different colors are used in parallel, a phenomenon called multiplexing. Yi carried the multiplexing concept into the quantum realm.\nMicro is key to his team's success. UVA is a pioneer and a leader in the use of optical multiplexing to create a scalable quantum computing platform. In 2014, Pfister's group succeeded in generating more than 3,000 quantum modes in a bulk optical system. However, using this many quantum modes requires a large footprint to contain the thousands of mirrors, lenses and other components that would be needed to run an algorithm and perform other operations.\n\"The future of the field is integrated quantum optics,\" Pfister said. \"Only by transferring quantum optics experiments from protected optics labs to field-compatible photonic chips will bona fide quantum technology be able to see the light of day. We are extremely fortunate to have been able to attract to UVA a world expert in quantum photonics such as Xu Yi, and I'm very excited by the perspectives these new results open to us.\"\nYi's group created a quantum source in an optical microresonator a ring-shaped, millimeter-sized structure that envelopes the photons and generates a microcobe, a device that efficiently converts photons from single to multiple wavelengths. Light circulates around the ring to build up optical power. This power buildup enhances chances for photons to interact, which produces quantum entanglement between fields of light in the microcomb.\nThrough multiplexing, Yi's team verified the generation of 40 qumodes from a single microresonator on a chip, proving that multiplexing of quantum modes can work in integrated photonic platforms. This is just the number they are able to measure.\n\"We estimate that when we optimize the system, we can generate thousands of qumodes from a single device,\" Yi said.\nYi's multiplexing technique opens a path toward quantum computing for real-world conditions, where errors are inevitable. This is true even in classical computers. But quantum states are much more fragile than classical states.\nThe number of qubits needed to compensate for errors could exceed one million, with a proportionate increase in the number of devices. Multiplexing reduces the number of devices needed by two or three orders of magnitude.\nYi's photonics-based system offers two additional advantages in the quantum computing quest. Quantum computing platforms that use superconducting electronic circuits require cooling to cryogenic temperatures. Because the photon has no mass, quantum computers with photonic integrated chips can run or sleep at room temperature. Additionally, Lee fabricated the microresonator on a silicon chip using standard lithography techniques. This is important because it implies the resonator or quantum source can be mass-produced.\n\"We are proud to push the frontiers of engineering in quantum computing and accelerate the transition from bulk optics to integrated photonics,\" Yi said. \"We will continue to explore ways to integrate devices and circuits in a photonics-based quantum computing platform and optimize its performance.\"\n",

The T901, GE’s next-generation rotorcraft engine, will power the U.S. Army’s UH-60 Black Hawk, AH-64 Apache, and Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). Engine testing is part of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the Army’s Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) program.\n“Testing of the first T901 engine was very successful with the engine accumulating more than 100 hours of run time,” said Tom Champion, GE’s T901 Program Director. “We were impressed with the performance and condition of the engine’s compressor, combustor, and turbine sections as well as the 3D-printed (additive) manufactured parts and ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components.”\nThe second T901 engine will undergo performance and controls testing in an upgraded test cell at GE’s Lynn, Massachusetts facility. GE upgraded three Lynn test cells for the T901 EMD engine test program. Upgrades included new systems to absorb the engine’s increased power, allow for no-load operation, improve instrumentation capability, and advance engine test controls. The second development engine will then travel to GE’s Evendale, Ohio, facility for altitude testing.\nA total of eight T901 engines will be part of a multi-year test campaign to the Army Military Airworthiness Certification Criteria standards. These standards will ensure an engine meets the Army’s requirements for design, production, and airworthiness. Once all testing is complete, the T901 engine will have undergone close to 1,500 hours of full-scale ground testing for preliminary flight rating and close to 5,000 hours of testing for full engine qualification.\nCompared to its T700 predecessor, the 3,000 shaft horsepower T901 engine provides 50% more power, enabling the U.S. Army to regain the Black Hawk and Apache aircraft’s payload and range capabilities in high and hot environments. The engine offers 25% better specific fuel consumption, which means less fuel usage and fewer carbon emissions. Increased component durability reduces life cycle costs. The T901 also maintains the same aircraft mounting and installation envelope as the T700 for easy retrofitting on the existing fleet.\n",

It takes us a step closer to the 'new frontier' of human habitat on the moon and this is a great source of inspiration and motivation for the whole team.\"\nThe space community has relied mainly on photovoltaic power systems, a technology that was originally developed for the purpose of space applications and has found many terrestrial uses. However, these systems pose severe limitations for missions to places like the outer solar system. The available solar energy reduces with the square of the distance from the sun. For example, at Saturn the solar power density is a hundred times smaller than at Earth. There is also the issue of the two week-long nights on the Moon.\nIt has meant that radioisotope power sources - sometimes referred to as nuclear batteries - fuelled with Pu-238 have generally been used in space missions since the early 1960s.

However, their rigid nature limits their use in flexible electronics. Made of single-atom-thick layers, 2D materials can be dispersed in solution and formulated into printable inks, producing ultra-thin films that are extremely flexible, semi-transparent and with novel electronic properties.\nThis opens up the possibility of new types of devices, such as those that can be integrated into flexible and stretchable materials, like clothes, paper, or even tissues into the human body.\nPreviously, researchers have built several flexible electronic devices from printed 2D material inks, but these have been one-off 'proof-of-concept' components, built to show how one particular property, such as high electron mobility, light detection, or charge storage can be realized.\nHowever, without knowing which parameters to control in order to design printed 2D material devices, their widespread use has been limited. Now, the international research team have studied how electronic charge is transported in several inkjet-printed films of 2D materials, showing how it is controlled by changes in temperature, magnetic field, and electric field.\nThe team investigated three typical types of 2D materials: graphene (a 'semimetal' built from a single layer of carbon atoms), molybdenum disulphide (or MoS2, a 'semiconductor') and titanium carbide MXene (or Ti3C2, a metal) and mapped how the behaviour of the electrical charge transport changed under these different conditions.\nLead researcher Dr. Felice Torrisi, from the Department of Chemistry at Imperial, said: \"Our results have a huge impact on the way we understand the transport through networks of two-dimensional materials, enabling not only the controlled design and engineering of future printed electronics based on 2D materials, but also new types of flexible electronic devices.\n\"For example, our work paves the way to reliable wearable devices suitable for biomedical applications, such as the remote monitoring of patients, or bio-implantable devices for long-term monitoring of degenerative diseases or healing processes.\"\nThese future devices could one day replace invasive procedures, such as implanting brain electrodes to monitor degenerative conditions that affect the nervous system. Electrodes can only be implanted on a temporary basis, and are uncomfortable for the patient, whereas a flexible device made of biocompatible 2D materials could be integrated with the brain and provide constant monitoring.\nOther potential healthcare applications include wearable devices for monitoring healthcare—devices like fitness watches, but more integrated with the body, providing sufficiently accurate data to allow doctors to monitor patients without bringing them into hospital for tests.\nThe relationships the team discovered between 2D material type and the controls on electrical charge transport will help other researchers design printed and flexible 2D material devices with the properties they desire, based on how they need the electrical charge to act.\nThey could also reveal how to design entirely new types of electrical components impossible using silicon chips, such as transparent components or ones that modify and transmit light in new ways.\nCo-author Professor Renato Gonnelli, from the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, said: \"The fundamental understanding of how the electrons are transported through networks of 2D materials underpins the way we manufacture printed electronic components. By identifying the mechanisms responsible for such electronic transport, we will be able to achieve the optimum design of high-performance printed electronics.\"\nCo-first author Adrees Arbab, from the Cambridge Graphene Centre and the Department of Chemistry at Imperial, said: \"In addition, our study could unleash the new electronic and optoelectronic devices exploiting the innovative properties of graphene and other 2D materials, such as incredibly high mobility, optical transparency, and mechanical strength.\"\n",

        "源标题": "FREEMELT PATENTS ‘FREEZING’ TECHNOLOGY FOR FINISHING 3D PRINTED PARTS WITH COMPLEX INTERNAL CHANNELS",
        "原文": "Swedish 3D printer manufacturer Freemelt has been granted patents for a novel approach to post-processing that allows excess powder to be ‘frozen’ out of complex parts.\nDesigned for finishing powder bed fusion printed parts, the process involves filling them with saline water, which is then frozen in a way that breaks the links between powder grains stuck in their internal channels, making any excess easier to eject.\nIt’s thought that the technology, which is now patented in the US and Europe, could soon enable 3D printing to be used in a wider range of applications, particularly in the creation of gas turbine components with intricate internal features.\n“This innovation increases the opportunities to use 3D printing technology in more application areas and can increase the competitiveness of our customers,” explains Ulric Ljungblad, Co-founder and CEO of Freemelt. “Examples of this are heat exchangers that often have a lot of cavities that are difficult to access.”\nFreemelt’s metal 3D printing mission\nSince it was established five years ago, Freemelt has been on a mission to advance the development of materials for use within metal 3D printing. In large part, the firm has sought to achieve this via the Freemelt ONE, an electron beam machine (EBM) with a vacuum chamber, recoating mechanism and adaptable powder feeding system, that’s said to be ideal for engaging in advanced metal powder R&D.\nAlready, the 3D printer has already been installed at numerous research facilities. In June, Freemelt received its first Slovenian order via the University of Maribor, which intends to use the system as a means of identifying orthopedic implant materials.\nThe company also continues to advance the capabilities of the Freemelt ONE through its own internal R&D programs. Back in September 2020, Freemelt came up with ‘ProHeat,’ a novel method of preheating the powder bed. Since then, the 3D printer developer has also launched its Pixelmelt process optimization tool, which enables users to modify parameters across several parts in a single build.\nFreezing out excess materials\nAs outlined in Freemelt’s newly-granted US and European patents, its novel post-processing approach is designed to address the issues that currently surround the finishing of parts with complex internals. Specifically, the firm says that when 3D printed, these components can be left with residual powder inside them, either due to semi-sintering, a binder holding grains together or friction-induced interlocking.\nWhile many approaches to clearing excess material exist, including the use of rotating tools and ultrasonic methods to separate and flush out powder particles, Freemelt’s patents outline an alternative that relies on “thermal shock” instead.\nThe company claims that freezing water pumped into the channels of such parts, makes it expand by 10%, in a way that effectively “breaks the forces holding powder grains together.” In addition to making unwanted materials easier to remove, this phase change is said to be repeatable. As such, the patents claim cycled phase transformations can allow pressure to be built up to clear stubborn blockages.\nMoving forwards, Freemelt’s patents say that removing dissolved gas from the water used to fill parts “may be advantageous,” in that it would reduce the risk of ‘pockets’ forming inside cavities which aren’t affected by thermal shock. In the documents, the firm also suggests that post-freezing, powders can be removed in various ways, with ultrasonic methods achieving “efficient energy transfer.”\nAs with many patents, Freemelt’s are quite broad in their application, covering the finishing of parts with one or more internal cavities and “at least one external opening,” that have excess cleared via a “phase transition from liquid to solid phases.” In particular though, the documents outline its potential as a means of treating gas turbine parts, the likes of which tend to have narrow cooling channels.\nFor those interested, Freemelt’s USPTO patent and Freemelt’s European patent office patent can be viewed via the websites of either organization under the title ‘Freezing method for cleaning an additive manufacturing part.’\nFast-tracking the finishing process\nThough often necessary in preparing 3D printed parts for end-usage, post-processing is regularly cited as a ‘bottleneck’ slowing down their production, and preventing their mass manufacture. As such, a significant amount of research continues to be conducted into accelerating the process, some of which has yielded component finishing innovations that have already made it to market.\nLuxYours, for instance, was granted a patent for its Iterative Flux Smoothing process back in 2020, which it has since been integrated into its LUXMatic700 systems. By liquifying the outer layer of 3D printed parts, before allowing it to re-form with a high level of surface finish, the technology is said to yield stronger products that don’t develop loose particles or feature soiling, making them much easier to clean.\nAdditive Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) has also partnered with Japanese electronics manufacturer Mitsubishi Electric to develop a fully-automated post-processing machine for plastic parts. Effectively a combination of the PostPro3D and Mitsubishi’s articulated arm robots, the system is designed to significantly increase productivity, from a few parts finished per hour up to hundreds.\nElsewhere, in ceramic 3D printing, XJet has launched its Support Material Automatic Removal Technology or ‘SMART’ post-processing station. Marketed as the ‘last link in the chain’ for automated end-to-end 3D printing, the SMART unit uses intelligent algorithms to automatically remove supports, thus freeing up engineers to go and spend their time on more value-generating activities.\n",
        "中文原文": "瑞典3D打印机制造商Freemelt获得了一项新的后处理方法的专利，该方法允许将复杂部件中的多余粉末“冷冻”出来。设计用于完成粉末床熔合印刷零件，该过程包括用盐水填充它们，然后以一种方式冻结，打破粘在内部通道中的粉末颗粒之间的联系，使任何多余的更容易喷出。人们认为，这项现已在美国和欧洲获得专利的技术，可能很快将3D打印应用于更广泛的应用领域，尤其是在制造具有复杂内部特征的燃气轮机部件方面。Freemelt联合创始人兼首席执行官Ulric Ljungblad解释说：“这一创新增加了在更多应用领域使用3D打印技术的机会，并可以提高我们客户的竞争力。”“这方面的例子是热交换器，通常有许多难以接近的腔。”弗里梅尔特的金属3D打印任务自五年前成立以来，Freemelt一直致力于推进金属3D打印材料的开发。在很大程度上，该公司试图通过Freemelt ONE来实现这一目标，Freemelt ONE是一种电子束机(EBM)，具有真空室、再加工机构和适应性强的送粉系统，据说这是从事先进金属粉末研发的理想选择。3D打印机已经安装在许多研究机构。今年6月，Freemelt通过马里博尔大学收到了第一份斯洛文尼亚订单，该大学打算使用该系统作为识别骨科植入材料的手段。该公司还通过自己的内部研发计划继续推进Freemelt ONE的能力。早在2020年9月，Freemelt就提出了“ProHeat”，这是一种预热粉末床的新方法。此后，这家3D打印机开发商还推出了其Pixelmelt流程优化工具，该工具使用户能够在一次构建中跨几个部分修改参数。冻结多余的材料正如Freemelt新授予的美国和欧洲专利所概述的那样，其新颖的后处理方法旨在解决当前围绕复杂内部零件精加工的问题。具体地说，该公司表示，当3D打印时，这些组件内部可能会留下残余粉末，这可能是由于半烧结、将颗粒保持在一起的粘合剂或摩擦诱导的互锁。虽然有许多清除多余物质的方法，包括使用旋转工具和超声波方法来分离和冲洗粉末颗粒，但Freemelt的专利概述了一种依赖“热冲击”的替代方案。该公司声称，泵入这些部件通道的冷冻水使其膨胀10%，以一种有效地“打破将粉末颗粒聚集在一起的力量”的方式。除了使不想要的材料更容易去除之外，这种相变据说是可重复的。因此，专利要求循环相变可以允许压力建立起来，以清除顽固的堵塞。向前看，Freemelt的专利说，从用于填充零件的水中去除溶解气体“可能是有利的”，因为它将降低在不受热冲击影响的腔体内形成“口袋”的风险。在文件中，该公司还建议，冷冻后，粉末可以以各种方式去除，超声波方法实现了“有效的能量转移”。与许多专利一样，Freemelt的应用范围相当广泛，涵盖了带有一个或多个内部腔体和“至少一个外部开口”的零件的精加工，这些零件通过“从液体到固相的相变”而清除了多余的部分。然而，特别是，文件概述了它作为处理燃气轮机零件的一种手段的潜力，类似的零件往往有狭窄的冷却通道。对于那些感兴趣的人，Freemelt的USPTO专利和Freemelt的欧洲专利局专利可以通过任何一个组织的网站在标题为“清洁增材制造零件的冷冻方法”下查看。快速跟踪精加工过程尽管在准备3D打印零件以供最终使用时通常是必要的，但后处理经常被认为是减缓其生产并阻止其大规模生产的“瓶颈”。因此，大量的研究继续进行，以加速该过程，其中一些已经产生了组件精加工创新，并已使其进入市场。例如，LuxYours早在2020年就获得了迭代通量平滑过程的专利，此后它被集成到其LUXMatic700系统中。mak说，这项技术通过液化3D打印零件的外层，然后让它以高水平的表面光洁度重新成形，可以生产出更坚固的产品，不会产生松散的颗粒或弄脏的特征",

When such components are manufactured by 3D printing, it may be difficult to remove residual powder from these passages, and the powder may also stick into the cavities for a variety of reasons (for example, powder particles with high bulk density may simply lock each other by friction; Heat generated during 3D printing may cause powder particles to semi-sintered with each other; Another possible reason is that powder particles are held together by binders added to the powder in earlier process steps, etc.). At present, the common methods to remove internal powder, such as using rotating tools and ultrasonic methods to separate powder particles from each other, and then transport the powder out of the channel.This patent uses water and is based on the idea that water expands by about 10% when it changes from liquid phase to solid phase, and this expansion can be used to break the adhesion of powder particles in the internal cavity, thus promoting the removal of powder. In order to break the adhesion between powder particles more effectively, the medium can be water with dissolved salt, such as sodium chloride (such as 0.5 ~ 26% sodium chloride solution) or other solutes. When salt water freezes, it will begin to form solid ice areas, that is, solid water, and salt will spread from the early frozen ice areas. The effect of using brine will prolong the phase transition with time, because the concentration of salt can change dynamically, so salt will propagate around the cavity, resulting in different interstitial volumes freezing at different times. Compared with non-brine, brine will produce more significant local ice volume and more uniform transformation from liquid phase to solid phase, which will help to break the powder connection more effectively. Phase transitions are repeatable, so cyclic phase transitions can create more omni-directional pressures and remove stubborn blockage.This technology has been patented in the United States and Europe, and its novel post-processing method aims to solve the finishing problem of complex internal components, which is expected to make 3D printing technology applied to a wider range of fields soon, especially in manufacturing gas turbine components with complex internal characteristics."

        "原文": "GAO-22-105834Published: Mar 30, 2022. Publicly Released: Mar 30, 2022.\nThe Defense Department believes that artificial intelligence will transform warfare, and failure to adopt AI technology could hinder national security. DOD is making organizational changes and investing billions of dollars to incorporate AI technology.\nWe found that DOD's AI-related strategies could be more comprehensive, such as by including full descriptions of the resources needed for developing AI-enabled technologies. In addition, DOD has not yet issued guidance that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of components that participate in AI activities.\nOur7 recommendationsaddress these and other issues.\nWhat GAO Found\nThe 2018Department of Defense (DOD) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategydefines AI as the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The strategy and associated plans include some, but not all, characteristics of a comprehensive strategy.For example, DOD's nine AI-related strategies and plans do not include full descriptions of resources and investments and risk associated with adoption of AI-enabled technologies (See fig.). Issuing guidance to include all characteristics of a comprehensive strategy in future AI-related strategies could help DOD be better positioned to help managers ensure accountability and responsible use of AI.\nDOD has begun to identify and report on its AI activities, but limitations exist in its AI baseline inventory, such as the exclusion of classified activities. DOD officials said these limitations will be addressed in subsequent phases of the AI inventory identification process. However, DOD has not yet developed a high-level plan or roadmap that captures all requirements and milestones. Such a plan would provide DOD with a high-level, end-to-end view of all the features necessary to accomplish the program's goal to provide a complete and accurate inventory of AI activities to Congress and to DOD decision makers.\nDOD organizations collaborate on AI activities, but can more fully incorporate leading collaboration practices. DOD uses a variety of formal and informal collaborative mechanisms that GAO's prior work has identified, such as interagency groups. DOD has partially incorporated leading collaboration practices, such as identifying leadership. However, DOD officials told us they are in the process of developing guidance and agreements that clearly define the roles and responsibilities of DOD components that participate in AI activities. By finalizing and issuing such guidance, DOD could help ensure all participants agree upon responsibilities and decision making on AI efforts across the department.\nWhy GAO Did This Study\nDOD strategies state that AI will transform the character of warfare, and failure to adopt AI technology could hinder the capability of warfighters to defend our nation. DOD is making organizational changes and investing billions of dollars to incorporate AI technology, such as establishing the Joint AI Center to accelerate the delivery of AI-enabled capabilities across DOD.\nHouse Report 116-442 accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, includes a provision for GAO to assess DOD's resources, capabilities, and plans for AI technology. This report evaluates the extent to which (1) DOD's AI Strategy and associated plans include characteristics of a comprehensive strategy; (2) DOD has identified and reported AI activities across the department; and (3) DOD collaborates on its AI activities. GAO reviewed relevant laws and DOD strategies that outline plans and processes to manage AI across the department, interviewed officials, and conducted a department-wide survey. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in February 2022. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted.\nRecommendations\nGAO is making seven recommendations, including for DOD to issue guidance to include all characteristics of a comprehensive strategy; develop a high-level plan or roadmap for its AI inventory process; and finalize and issue guidance and agreements that define roles and responsibilities for AI collaboration. DOD concurred with all seven of these recommendations.\n",

        "源标题": "FUELING FUTURE BATTLEFIELDS: MARINE CORPS COMMANDS COME TOGETHER TO DRIVE FORCE MODERNIZATION EFFORTS",
        "原文": "17 NOV 2022|Johannes SchmidtMarine Corps Systems Command\nALBANY, GA, UNITED STATES --\nAlthough the United States has enjoyed an asymmetrical logistical advantage since the end of World War II, emerging needs associated with the sustainment of fuel requirements in future battlefields have presented challenges for military leadership and the warfighter alike. Marine Corps Systems Command’s Fuel and Water Team recently initiated efforts to develop the Expeditionary Fuel Dispensing System, which provides increased battlefield flexibility to Marines. Also known as EFDS, the new program of record reconfigures capabilities existent in legacy fuel systems, such as the Amphibious Assault Fuel System – AAFS -- and the Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing System – TAFDS -- into smaller, more agile expedient capabilities. “EFDS allows Marine Corps Systems Command to replace legacy systems,” explained EFDS Lead Logistician Linnis Hobbs. “It increases expeditionary capabilities by allowing the Bulk Fuel Marines to choose between a small, medium or large containerized system.” Although the EFDS can still handle large amounts of fuel, the system enables commanders to select tailored bulk fuel capabilities instead of having to employ large, cumbersome legacy fuel systems while executing missions in distributed operational environments. “We're looking at a much smaller footprint. EFDS allows us to take a 1.1-million-gallon fuel farm and break it down into much smaller pieces,” said EFDS Project Officer Master Sgt. Vidal Rojas Giron. “It really makes things much more manageable.” As Russian logistical failures during the earliest days of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine have demonstrated, the decentralization of fuel systems – and the elimination of “liquid mountains” – is a necessary capability in a world where rival powers have access to precisions weapons systems.\n\"We're looking at a much smaller footprint. EFDS allows us to take a 1.1-million-gallon fuel farm and break it down into much smaller pieces,”said EFDS Project Officer Master Sgt. Vidal Rojas Giron.\n\"Unlike the logistical buildup seen in past conflicts, our competitors -- as named in the recently released National Security Strategy -- can identify our ‘liquid mountains’ with their ISR assets and range us with their weapon system capabilities. Understanding that fuel is the pacing commodity, EFDS enables the fleet commander to understand the mission they have been assigned and then select their equipment sets to fit that specific scenario while operating and sustaining inside the enemy’s Weapons Engagement Zone,” explained Maj. Craig Warner, project team leader of the Fuel and Water Team. To expedite the fuel systems modernization efforts, MARCORSYSCOM’s Program Manager Engineer Systems recently teamed up with II Marine Expeditionary Force, Marine Corps Logistics Command and Marine Force Storage Command to conduct an inventory of all AAFS and TAFDS bulk fuel assets located in storage at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Georgia. Between Aug. 22 and Oct. 22, 2022, Marines from II MEF came together to inventory and inspect legacy fuel systems to determine if the equipment is viable to fill Fleet needs and improve readiness, while simultaneously informing the acquisition strategy development for the EFDS – demonstrating the power that exists when various Marine Corps commands collaborate and function together to provide key support for the Fleet Marine Force. “Since there was excess equipment in storage at Albany, the MARCORSYSCOM Program Office briefed LOGCOM and Marine Corps Storage Command about the need to transfer equipment for the upcoming EFDS efforts,” explained Hobbs. “We knew that this effort couldn’t be done alone and required a large number of resources. A lot of the manpower was provided by LOGCOM -- civilians and uniformed personnel -- and II MEF Marines from 8th ESB, 2nd Maintenance Battalion, Marine Wing Support Squadron 273, and MWSS-272.”\nAlthough running inventory and clearing warehouses might not sound like a newsworthy feat, Warner believes the efforts will provide immediate results – and increase the lethality of warfighters on the ground today. “These efforts will bear immediate fruit and I couldn’t be more grateful to our partners across the Corps. Thanks to the collaboration with LOGCOM and II MEF, we now have a much better understanding of our inventory. We’ll be able to immediately send equipment to the Fleet, thus improving their material readiness, and we now have better data to support our acquisitions and lifestyle cost estimate development,” Hobbs noted. “Everybody’s been giving their best because what we’re doing for EFDS won’t just benefit the Corps today, but for generations to come. I really think we’re part of something bigger than ourselves and through Force Design 2030, we’re doing our part to help shape the battlefields of the future,” said Rojas Giron. But Warner says there’s still more work to be done and MCSC will partner with I MEF Marines to conduct a similar effort at MCLB Barstow in January 2023. “We’re taking the lessons learned during the MCLB Albany effort and applying them at MLCB Barstow. I look forward to working with I MEF Marines to help continue this modernization effort, fully recognizing that it will ultimately increase the Corps’ readiness and lethality,” he noted.\n",

        "原文": "Airbus Helicopters has secured a long-awaited contract to develop its new H160 commercial helicopter into a military platform for use by three branches of the French Armed Forces.\nThe 10 billion （$11.3 billion）contract for the Joint Light Helicopter （HIL）program was signed Dec. 22. It covers the development of the military H160M, known as the Guepard （Cheetah）, the procurement of 169 helicopters, the development and implementation of a support and training system and maintenance of the fleet for 10 years. Deliveries will begin in 2027.\nThe contract will also cover the purchase of 10 more H160s for the French military police, the Gendarmerie, and one H160 for the French defense materiel agency, the DGA, for use as a flying test bench.\nThe HIL program aims to use the H160 to replace several disparate types in French service. They include Aerospatiale Gazelles used by the Army, Alouette III, Dauphin and Panther platforms flown by the Navy and AS550 Fennec used by the Air Force and Navy.\nFrench Defense Minister Florence Parly described the HIL program as a “concrete example of the renewal of our [defense] equipment,” adding that the fleet would “improve availability and reduce maintenance costs.”\nAirbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even said the H160M selection was the result of 10 years of close cooperation with the DGA and the French Armed Forces.\n“The H160M will bring new capabilities to the armed forces, as it is adapted to modern warfare thanks to its increased connectivity, maneuverability, low acoustic footprint, and a fully integrated support system,” Even said. He also noted that the French Armed Forces would be a reference for export customers to follow. The company has previously said there could be opportunities to sell an additional 400 Guepards in the coming years.\nThe contract comes just days after Airbus declared the commercial H160 had entered service with a commercial operator, All Nippon Helicopters in Japan.\nThe HIL contract is a significant boost for the H160 program, which had initially struggled with order intake. The H160 was partially designed with the HIL program in mind.\nOf the 169 helicopters in the HIL program, the first 30 aircraft are firm orders, with 21 destined for the French Army, eight for the Navy and one for the Air Force.\nAn additional 80 aircraft are destined for the Army to act as aerial scouts and provide fire support and special forces capabilities. Another 49 will be inducted into the French Navy, operating from its ships and providing a light anti-ship missile attack capability. The remaining 40 will serve with the Air Force, performing the airspace surveillance mission that includes quick reaction alert to low-speed air threats and search-and-rescue missions.\nPrior to delivery of the Guepards, the French Navy will take delivery of six commercial model H160s for the search-and-rescue mission. These aircraft are being provided through a commercial arrangement by a consortium of Airbus, Babcock and Safran.\nThe French defense ministry says the program will support Airbus Helicopters’ military activities for the next 15 years and provide a boost to the aircraft’s supply chain, much of which is located in country.\nEven previously told the La Tribune financial newspaper in November that the HIL program would give the company “very important visibility” in the years ahead.\nThe H160M will differ from the commercial model, featuring the Thales FlytX avionics suite rather than Airbus’ own Helionix. The Air Force aircraft will also be equipped with a Thales-developed AirMaster C compact flat panel active electronically scanned array （AESA）surveillance radar. Airbus also plans to integrate its Hforce generic weapons system on the platform, allowing it to use a mix of guided and unguided weapons including the MBDA ANL anti-ship missile on the naval version. Guepards will also feature a self-protection suite, satellite communications systems, tactical data links and electro-optical cameras.\n",

Rickover (SSN 795), was christened during a ceremony at General Dynamics’ Electric Boat shipyard facility in Groton, Connecticut, July 31, the U.S. Navy said in a release.\n“This submarine is a fitting tribute to Admiral Rickover, who truly transformed our Navy,” said Adm. James Caldwell, director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, during his remarks at the celebration.\nCaldwell credited Rickover — who served for 63 years in the Navy and is credited with spurring the service to adopt nuclear propulsion after World War II — with not only technological advances but cultural ones. He lauded Rickover’s legendary work ethic, frankness, attention to detail and commitment to excellence, which he said has since permeated throughout the Navy.\n“It’s really great to see this ship come together, and to see so many people here to celebrate the christening of the Hyman G. Rickover and honor the Hyman G. Rickover legacy,” said Cmdr. Thomas Niebel, commanding officer of the newly christened submarine.\nThe Honorable James F. Geurts, performing the duties of Under Secretary of the Navy, told those in attendance that the construction of the future USS Hyman G. Rickover is a testament to the dedication of America’s shipbuilders and sailors.\n“We did not close a shipyard, public or private, for one day during the pandemic,” Geurts said. “The sustained commitment to excellence displayed by this workforce shows in the construction of this boat and adheres to the culture of excellence promoted by Hyman G. Rickover.\n“It’s not just a matter of having the world’s best ships,” he continued, “you have to have the world’s best Sailors to maintain the world’s best Navy, and we have both.”\nDarleen Greenert, the submarine’s sponsor, a Navy veteran, and wife of former Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert, highlighted the sacrifice of military families during her remarks, and remembered the late Eleonore Rickover, the namesake admiral’s wife.\n“She set the bar [for ship sponsors],” Greenert said of Eleonore Rickover, who was the sponsor for a previous Los Angeles-class submarine to bear the Hyman G. Rickover name, SSN 709. “She loved her crew.”\nThe first Hyman G. Rickover was commissioned at Submarine Base, New London, in Groton, on July 21, 1984. SSN 709 and its crew deployed 12 times until its decommissioning in December 2007. Over the years, its decorations included the Atlantic Fleet Golden Anchor Award, Submarine Squadron Eight’s anti-submarine warfare white “A” and engineering red “E” awards and the prestigious Sixth Fleet “Hook ‘Em” award for anti-submarine warfare excellence.\nGreenert asked family members of the crew of the future USS Hyman G. Rickover to stand together when her daughter, Matron of Honor Sarah Greenert McNichol, broke the ceremonial bottle of sparkling wine across the bow.\nOther speakers at the ceremony included Electric Boat President Kevin Graney, Newport News Shipbuilding President Jennifer Boykin, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-CT and U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-RI.\nRickover will eventually joint the fleet with a displacement of 7,835 tons, crew of 132, and a weapons payload of 12 vertical launch systems and four torpedo tubes.\nFast-attack submarines like Rickover are multi-mission platforms enabling five of the six Navy maritime strategy core capabilities — sea control, power projection, forward presence, maritime security, and deterrence. The submarine is designed to excel in anti-submarine warfare; anti-ship warfare; strike warfare; special operations; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare – from open ocean anti-submarine warfare to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, to projecting power ashore with Special Operation Forces and Tomahawk cruise missiles in the prevention or preparation of regional crises.\n",

        "源标题": "Superconducting X-ray laser reaches operating temperature colder than outer space",
        "原文": "Nestled 30 feet underground in Menlo Park, California, a half-mile-long stretch of tunnel is now colder than most of the universe. It houses a new superconducting particle accelerator, part of an upgrade project to the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray free-electron laser at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.\nCrews have successfully cooled the accelerator to minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit—or 2 Kelvin—a temperature at which it becomes superconducting and can boost electrons to high energies with nearly zero energy lost in the process. It is one of the last milestones before LCLS-II will produce X-ray pulses that are 10,000 times brighter, on average, than those of LCLS and that arrive up to a million times per second—a world record for today's most powerful X-ray light sources.\n\"In just a few hours, LCLS-II will produce more X-ray pulses than the current laser has generated in its entire lifetime,\" says Mike Dunne, director of LCLS. \"Data that once might have taken months to collect could be produced in minutes. It will take X-ray science to the next level, paving the way for a whole new range of studies and advancing our ability to develop revolutionary technologies to address some of the most profound challenges facing our society.\"\nWith these new capabilities, scientists can examine the details of complex materials with unprecedented resolution to drive new forms of computing and communications; reveal rare and fleeting chemical events to teach us how to create more sustainable industries and clean energy technologies; study how biological molecules carry out life's functions to develop new types of pharmaceuticals; and peek into the bizarre world of quantum mechanics by directly measuring the motions of individual atoms.\nA chilling feat\nLCLS, the world's first hard X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL), produced its first light in April 2009, generating X-ray pulses a billion times brighter than anything that had come before. It accelerates electrons through a copper pipe at room temperature, which limits its rate to 120 X-ray pulses per second.\nIn 2013, SLAC launched the LCLS-II upgrade project to boost that rate to a million pulses and make the X-ray laser thousands of times more powerful. For that to happen, crews removed part of the old copper accelerator and installed a series of 37 cryogenic accelerator modules, which house pearl-like strings of niobium metal cavities. These are surrounded by three nested layers of cooling equipment, and each successive layer lowers the temperature until it reaches nearly absolute zero—a condition at which the niobium cavities become superconducting.\n\"Unlike the copper accelerator powering LCLS, which operates at ambient temperature, the LCLS-II superconducting accelerator operates at 2 Kelvin, only about 4 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature,\" said Eric Fauve, director of the Cryogenic Division at SLAC. \"To reach this temperature, the linac is equipped with two world-class helium cryoplants, making SLAC one of the significant cryogenic landmarks in the U.S. and on the globe. The SLAC Cryogenics team has worked on site throughout the pandemic to install and commission the cryogenic system and cool down the accelerator in record time.\"\nOne of these cryoplants, built specifically for LCLS-II, cools helium gas from room temperature all the way down to its liquid phase at just a few degrees above absolute zero, providing the coolant for the accelerator.\nOn April 15, the new accelerator reached its final temperature of 2 K for the first time and today, May 10, the accelerator is ready for initial operations.\n\"The cooldown was a critical process and had to be done very carefully to avoid damaging the cryomodules,\" said Andrew Burrill, director of SLAC's Accelerator Directorate. \"We're excited that we've reached this milestone and can now focus on turning on the X-ray laser.\"\nBringing it to life\nIn addition to a new accelerator and a cryoplant, the project required other cutting-edge components, including a new electron source and two new strings of undulator magnets that can generate both \"hard\" and \"soft\" X-rays. Hard X-rays, which are more energetic, allow researchers to image materials and biological systems at the atomic level. Soft X-rays can capture how energy flows between atoms and molecules, tracking chemistry in action and offering insights into new energy technologies. To bring this project to life, SLAC teamed up with four other national labs—Argonne, Berkeley Lab, Fermilab and Jefferson Lab—and Cornell University.\nJefferson Lab, Fermilab and SLAC pooled their expertise for research and development on cryomodules. After constructing the cryomodules, Fermilab and Jefferson Lab tested each one extensively before the vessels were packed and shipped to SLAC by truck. The Jefferson Lab team also designed and helped procure the elements of the cryoplants.\n\"The LCLS-II project required years of effort from large teams of technicians, engineers and scientists from five different DOE laboratories across the U.S. and many colleagues from around the world,\" says Norbert Holtkamp, SLAC deputy director and the project director for LCLS-II. \"We couldn't have made it to where we are now without these ongoing partnerships and the expertise and commitment of our collaborators.\"\nToward first X-rays\nNow that the cavities have been cooled, the next step is to pump them with more than a megawatt of microwave power to accelerate the electron beam from the new source. Electrons passing through the cavities will draw energy from the microwaves so that by the time the electrons have passed through all 37 cryomodules, they'll be moving close to the speed of light. Then they'll be directed through the undulators, forcing the electron beam on a zigzag path. If everything is aligned just right—to within a fraction of the width of a human hair—the electrons will emit the world's most powerful bursts of X-rays.\nThis is the same process that LCLS uses to generate X-rays. However, since LCLS-II uses superconducting cavities instead of warm copper cavities based on 60-year-old technology, it can can deliver up to a million pulses per second, 10,000 times the number of X-ray pulses for the same power bill.\nOnce LCLS-II produces its first X-rays, which is expected to happen later this year, both X-ray lasers will work in parallel, allowing researchers to conduct experiments over a wider energy range, capture detailed snapshots of ultrafast processes, probe delicate samples and gather more data in less time, increasing the number of experiments that can be performed. It will greatly expand the scientific reach of the facility, allowing scientists from across the nation and around the world to pursue the most compelling research ideas.\n",

        "源标题": "Ukraine’s Shadowy Kamikaze Drone Boats Officially Break Cover",
        "原文": "Ukraine hopes to raise enough money to build 100 of these unmanned surface vessels to counter Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.\nWe have now gotten our best look yet at Ukraine's tactical uncrewed surface vessels, or USVs, which were employed in an unprecedented attack on the Russian Navy's base in Sevastopol on the occupied Crimean Peninsula last month, thanks to an official crowdfunding campaign. Ukrainian authorities say they hope to raise enough funds to buy 100 of the drone boats, which they claim are capable of striking targets as far away as 500 miles, among other missions.\nNew video footage and images of the USVs were released by the Ukrainian government Friday through its UNITED24 fundraising platform as part of an effort to crowdsource funding for the boats. The USVs, completed and under construction, are 18-foot-long vessels said to be capable of carrying a combat load of up to 400 pounds, with a top maximum speed of about 50 mph. Each USV has a $250,000 price tag that the website says includes a ground-based, autonomous control station, a transportation and storage system, and \"a data processing center.\" It is unclear exactly what is meant by a data processing center and officials from UNITED24 declined to answer, citing operational security concerns.\nConsidering that some of the cost includes ancillary items like the transportation and storage system, and maybe the data processing center, the actual cost of just the USVs is likely lower. It really isn't clear how they would cost that much, but they are handmade with some key enabling technologies. Regardless, they are orders of magnitude cheaper than something like the Naval Strike Missile, for instance, which has an individual price tag of $2,194,000. You can read more about the cost of the U.S. Navy's ship-launched missiles here.\nUNITED24 is an initiative of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to raise funds for a wide array of items needed by Ukraine's military and civilians.UNITED24\n“We must defend the waters of our seas and peaceful cities from Russian missiles launched from ships,” Zelensky wrote Friday on his Telegram channel. “Naval drones will also help unblock the corridor for civilian ships transporting grain for the world.”\nZelensky alluded to previous use of the USVs depicted on the website.\n“I am sure that millions of people will support this important area of Ukraine's defense,” he said. “Everyone has already seen how it works.”\nZelensky’s sentiments were echoed by the head of Ukraine’s Navy.\n“Such naval drones have already proven their effectiveness, and can change the situation in the Black Sea significantly,\" said Oleksiy Neizhpapa, Vice Admiral, Commander of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Navy, in a media release.\nImages and video posted on the UNITED24 website show a USV seemingly identical to those captured in images shared by Ukraine of USVs used in its Oct. 29 attack on Russia’s Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol.\nWhile the UNITED24 with claims that attack damaged at least three Russian warships, including the Admiral Grigorovich class frigate Admiral Makarov, reportedly the Black Sea Fleet's new flagship after the Project 1164 Slava-class cruiser Moskva sank in April, those claims are still unproven.\nYou can read much more about that attack, and its future implications here. They also appear very similar, if not identical to a USV that washed ashore in Crimea in late September.\nWhen Ukraine's unmanned suicide drone boat configuration first appeared on a rocky Crimean shoal, it was clear that they would become a major threat to contend with. The jet-black, very low-slung, jet-drive propelled almost kayak-like boat sported multiple camera systems, bow-mounted impact detonation sensors, and what appeared to be a satellite communications antenna, and was in a very different class than what we have seen before for this type of weapon.\nIt appears now that these are being purpose-built to be fast, maneuverable, hard to detect and engage, and above all else, have beyond line-of-sight control (BLOS) capability. While not uncommon on unmanned surface vessels today, it is new for ones that are intended to be expendable anti-ship weapons in their own right. Though it does appear that given the specifications include both an operational radius and maximum range, some might be deployed to be recoverable as well. It is unclear how many of these USVs may be currently operational.\nOn the other hand, it's possible that these could get into a target area autonomously using GPS navigation, then local 'pilots' picking them up within line-of-sight to control them for their terminal attack runs. There are big advantages in complexity and retaining the ability to dynamically maneuver and target when it actually matters with such a 'handoff' concept of operations. Also, it could act as a fallback for loss of BLOS control. Then again, maybe it is all done with broadband satellite, including man-the-loop-control, which would be a major achievement.\nThe specifications released on Friday give us a better understanding of how Ukraine could have pulled off such an attack 130 miles from its nearest shoreline.\nUNITED24 claims the USVs have an operational radius of up to about 250 miles, a range of up to about 500 miles, a maximum speed of about 50 miles per hour, and a \"maximum combat payload\" of about 400 pounds. It is unclear what UNITED24 means by maximum combat payload. It could be a combination of various things, including fuel and explosives, and these may be able to carry out other missions beyond strike using other payloads. This is another question we've asked them and will add additional details if provided.\nThey will supposedly be guided from a ground-based 'autonomous' control station — likely a point-and-click desktop semi-autonomous configuration — with the help of satellite navigation, or, in the case of GPS-denied areas, an inertial navigation system as well as visually through a video subsystem that also has night vision capabilities. We still don't know what network they're using for these, but observers have pointed out in the past that the apparent satellite antenna at the rear looks very similar to the ones available for use with Starlink.\nThe USVs are claimed to be able to operate autonomously for up to 60 hours, but again, it is unclear exactly what UNITED24 means by this. Again, we have reached out for clarification and will update this story with any additional information.\nIf these figures are accurate, it would allow the USVs to operate in a wide swath of the western and central Black Sea and easily in reach of Sevastopol.\nThese USVs, said Neizhpapa, “can participate in long-range maritime reconnaissance and coastal surveillance, escorting and supporting the traditional fleet, convoying merchant ships, zoning in artillery fire, defending our bases and countering amphibious operations.”\nThe Russian fleet “is constantly terrorizing Ukraine and our cities,” said Neizhpapa. “A fleet of “100 multipurpose surface devices will cement the success of the Navy, following the sinking of the Moskva cruiser and recapturing of Snake Island. They will also give us the opportunity to better protect both the sea and our country's entire territory.”\nRussia has launched more than 4,500 missiles at Ukraine, according to UNITED24, 20% of which came from the sea.\n“Ukraine had nothing to oppose these ships, because the Ukrainian fleet lost 80% of its vessels after the occupation of Crimea in 2014,” according to UNITED24.\nWhile that isn't exactly accurate, — Ukraine has been given RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles — with a reported operating radius of about up to 250 miles, the USVs also can strike far further than those anti-ship missile systems, which have a range of about 70 miles. They can also execute attacks in an entirely different, unconventional manner.\nWhile Ukraine hopes to raise enough money to build a fleet of USVs to make up for that deficit, it remains to be seen just how much money can be raised and how many will really be built.\nSince launching, UNITED24 claims to have received donations from 110 countries, money used to purchase, among other things, nearly 50,000 sets of body armor, nearly 45,000 helmets, nearly 75,000 uniforms, nearly 70,000 sets of tactical underwear, more than 1,400 drones and a helicopter.\nWe will keep an eye on this project to see just how many USVs are produced and how they are deployed.\n",
        "中文原文": "乌克兰希望筹集足够的资金建造100艘这种无人水面舰艇，以对抗俄罗斯的黑海舰队。由于一项官方众筹活动，我们现在已经最好地看到了乌克兰的战术无船员水面舰艇，即USV，这些舰艇上个月被用于对俄罗斯海军在被占领克里米亚半岛塞瓦斯托波尔的基地进行前所未有的袭击。乌克兰当局表示，他们希望筹集足够的资金购买100艘无人机，他们声称这些无人机能够打击500英里以外的目标，以及其他任务。乌克兰政府周五通过其UNITED24筹款平台发布了USVs的新视频片段和图像，作为为这些船只众筹资金的努力的一部分。已经完工并正在建造的USVs是18英尺长的船只，据说能够承载高达400磅的战斗载荷，最高速度约为每小时50英里。每辆USV都有25万美元的价格标签，该网站称，其中包括一个地面自主控制站、一个运输和存储系统以及“一个数据处理中心”。目前还不清楚数据处理中心的确切含义，UNITED24的官员以运营安全为由拒绝回答。考虑到一些成本包括辅助项目，如运输和存储系统，可能还有数据处理中心，仅仅USVs的实际成本可能更低。它真的不清楚如何会花费这么多，但它们是手工制作的一些关键的使能技术。不管怎样，它们比海军打击导弹便宜几个数量级，例如，海军打击导弹的单个价格标签为219.4万美元。你可以在这里阅读更多关于美国海军舰艇发射导弹的成本。UNITED24是乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽伦斯基的一项倡议，旨在为乌克兰军队和平民所需的一系列物品筹集资金。UNITED24泽伦斯基周五在他的电报频道上写道：“我们必须保卫我们的海域和和平城市免受俄罗斯从船只发射的导弹的攻击。”“海军无人机还将帮助畅通为世界运输粮食的民用船只的走廊。”泽伦斯基暗示了网站上描述的USVs的以前使用。“我相信数百万人将支持乌克兰国防的这一重要领域，”他说。“每个人都已经看到了它是如何工作的。”泽伦斯基的观点得到了乌克兰海军司令的回应。“这种海军无人机已经证明了它们的有效性，可以显著改变黑海的局势，”乌克兰海军海军司令、海军中将奥列克西·内兹帕帕（Oleksiy Neizhpapa）在一份媒体新闻稿中表示。UNITED24网站上发布的图像和视频显示，一架USV似乎与乌克兰分享的10月29日袭击俄罗斯塞瓦斯托波尔黑海舰队时使用的USV的图像相同。虽然24号联合声称袭击损坏了至少三艘俄罗斯军舰，包括格里戈罗维奇海军上将级护卫舰马卡罗夫海军上将号，据报道，马卡罗夫海军上将号是黑海舰队在1164斯拉瓦级巡洋舰莫斯科瓦号4月份沉没后的新旗舰，但这些说法仍未得到证实。您可以在这里阅读更多关于该攻击及其未来影响的信息。它们看起来也非常相似，如果不是完全相同的话，那就是9月下旬在克里米亚被冲上岸的一艘USV。当乌克兰的无人自杀无人机配置首次出现在克里米亚半岛的一个多岩石的浅滩上时，很明显，它们将成为一个需要应对的主要威胁。这种黑色的、非常低的悬挂、喷气驱动的、几乎像皮划艇一样的船只上有多个摄像系统、弓上安装的撞击引爆传感器和似乎是卫星通信天线，与我们以前见过的这种武器处于一个非常不同的级别。现在看来，它们的目的是快速、机动、难以探测和交战，最重要的是，具有超越视线控制(BLOS)的能力。虽然今天在无人驾驶的水面舰艇上并不少见，但对于那些本身就打算成为可消耗的反舰武器的舰艇来说，这是一种新的做法。尽管它确实看起来包括作战半径和最大射程的规格，一些可能被部署为可回收的以及。目前还不清楚这些USV中有多少可能正在运行。另一方面，它们有可能通过GPS导航自主进入目标区域，然后当地的“飞行员”在视线范围内将它们捡起来，控制它们进行最后的攻击。在复杂性和保持动态机动和目标的能力方面有很大的优势，当它实际上与这样的“切换”作战概念有关时。此外，它还可以作为失去BLOS控制的后退。话说回来，也许这一切都是由宽带卫星完成的，包括人-环控制，这将是一项重大成就。sp",

        "源标题": "Digital transformation is a key to maintaining US overmatch against China, Russia",
        "原文": "Take a page from Formula 1, for instance, to improve military efficiency, former Acting Army Secretary John Whitley writes.\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory recently demonstrated the advanced capabilities of the Advanced Automation for Agile Aerospace Applications (A5) Robotic System at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, for government and industry representatives. (U.S. Air Force courtesy photo/released)\nAs technology advances at a lightning pace, so do novel methods of weapon design, from 3D printing on the fly to virtual copies of real systems that can be field tested in cyberspace. In the op-ed below, former Acting Army Secretary John Whitley argues the Pentagon must do more to embrace the tech race, and bend its bureaucracy to do it.\nAfter two decades of counterterrorism warfare, the US is playing catchup as it refocuses on near-peer adversaries. China and Russia have been investing and modernizing to erode US overmatch, and their increasing aggression—on vivid display now as Russia invades Ukraine—has made acceleration of our defense modernization a national security imperative.\nThe defense enterprise is responding. The recent overhaul of defense acquisition is now being followed by a reform commission on Defense Department’s resource management process: the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Commission. These process reforms are valuable steps removing obstacles, but they don’t accelerate modernization by themselves.\nTo stay ahead of our adversaries, DoD must use these more flexible processes to adopt innovative business practices like digital transformation and as-a-service purchasing of capability — valuable strategies that must be a priority for the PPBE Commission and that DoD itself must incentivize when working with industry.\nDubbed the fourth industrial revolution, digital transformation is reshaping industries. In development, it allows faster and more flexible design iterations — shortening the process while improving alignment to mission need — by the use of a “digital twin.” This virtual representation of the product allows rapid simulation for “building before you build” and “flying before you buy” to reduce risk and accelerate time from design to fielding.\nThis is the first element of what Deloitte calls the physical-to-digital-to-physical (PDP) [PDF] loop. Creating a digital record from physical data allows development activities to be performed virtually—saving time while increasing the range of possibilities to reduce risk. This digitalization can even be started in the planning and requirements stages of DoD gap analysis.\nThese digitally engineered designs can then move more quickly through prototyping, testing, and production as the digital twin provides the data for printing initial parts, incorporating modifications, and feeding robotic and additive manufacturing processes. This “digital thread” completes the PDP loop as the digital representation guides physical production. Testing can be enhanced and risk reduced as thousands of “digital tests” are conducted to complement physical tests.\nAn updated digital twin matching the physical product then supports operations and sustainment. Formula One racing provides a vivid example — a digital twin integrated with extensive sensors on the car facilitates continuous management during a race to optimize performance [PDF]. Digitalization can improve uptime and readiness, operational performance, predict failures, reduce sustainment costs and support synthetic training environments.\nThe defense industry is bringing this transformation to DoD. For example, Lockheed Martin is using digital design to solve integration challenges with the CH-53K, and as the backbone of its Future Vertical Lift efforts. Last year, General Electric used skills honed in commercial additive manufacturing to win the first airworthiness certification from DoD for a printed aircraft engine part.\nParts of DoD are also climbing on board. The Air Force’s Research Lab is seeking to do more with digital manufacturing, while its ICBM-replacement effort already relies extensively on digital engineering. The Army is making digital twins to improve Black Hawk maintenance, working on battlefield 3D-printing of parts, and plans to choose among bidders for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft based on a digital design.\nTo accelerate modernization, DoD needs to harness digitalization’s benefits in reducing time, cost, and risk throughout a product’s life cycle. The question becomes: How can DoD leaders encourage faster transformation within DoD and the industrial base?\nFirst, DoD should expand digitalization into more capability and technology areas, including new development efforts and sustainment of current forces. Office of the Secretary of Defense organizations like Research and Engineering, Acquisition and Sustainment, and Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation could provide priorities for expansion while the Military Departments identify specific programs. The PPBE Commission could focus on expanding business practice innovation like digital transformation in its reform recommendations.\nSecond, DOD should incentivize industry by valuing advanced practices when writing proposal requests, making award selections, and issuing contracts. Program offices will need more experts in evaluating and using digital twins and the digital thread from development through sustainment. The cost-estimating community should look at commercial industry to learn what is possible, and how this might realistically change defense programs.\nThird, DOD should also smooth industry’s path by standardizing material requirements and accelerating certification [PDF] of printed parts. It should also establish intellectual property policies [PDF] that protect DoD while incentivizing industry investment.\nThis will be a learning process with missteps along the way. But today’s world requires DoD to implement digital transformation at scale and the only way to accomplish that is to do it.\n",

It strikes targets at ranges of up to 1,000 miles from its launch platform: historically Swiftsure and Trafalgar-class submarines and, for the past decade, Astute-class boats, based at Faslane.\nAmong the enhancements on the Block V missiles will be the improved ability to block attempts to jam/divert the Tomahawk from its target.\nAlongside upgrading the missile itself, the command systems on the boats and support ashore will also be modernised to meet the demands and requirements of the enhanced Tomahawk.\nThe first upgraded Tomahawks will be delivered to the Royal Navy’s fleet by 2024 with a test firing planned by an Astute-class boat the following year.\n",

Fully funded by NASA’sEstablished Program to Stimulate Competitive Research(EPSCoR), the collaboration will help explore novel ways to keep astronauts safe from microbial and parasitic contamination during space missions, which tend to increase notably in microgravity and confined spaces.\nThrough this grant funding, two new antimicrobial materials will be developed by Copper3D, then manufactured and tested for safety on Earth in a replica of theAdditive Manufacturing Facility(AMF), a commercial manufacturing platform that operates within the International Space Station (ISS) in low Earth orbit (LEO). Once the safety of the material has been validated, the team will prepare the materials for launch, operation, testing, and return-to-Earth activities.\nResearchers from UNO’sDepartment of Biomechanicswill work with NASA and 3D printer manufacturerMade in Space(now a subsidiary of space companyRedwireand creator of theAMF in-space 3D printer) to create the printed representations of the final in-space devices or test coupons and conduct post-testing of the antimicrobial effectiveness on Earth.\nAs one of the researchers collaborating in this project, UNO’s professor of 3D printed prosthetic and orthotic devices, Jorge Zuniga, described the importance of having new materials tools, medical devices, and other objects with antimicrobial properties in space missions. In addition, the co-director of theBiomechanics Rehabilitation and Manufacturing Initiative(BRMI) at UNO said that the most demanding challenges include finding solutions to help long-term space mission crews that suffer from an “immune system dysregulation,” which means a body can’t control immune responses.\nMost importantly, Zuniga said they have been seeking solutions to bacteria and viruses that tend to become more resistant to microgravity, which, added to the previous factor, makes space missions of more than six months in orbit very risky.\nHowever, an additional logistical factor has to be factored into the research, according to Zuniga. Considering the limited space available on the ISS and other future space exploration stations, crewed missions demand logistical support systems that are increasingly autonomous and decentralized, so they don’t need to use up precious cargo room for supplies and materials. One of the best solutions that have come up in recent years for this problem is 3D printing technology. Ideally, astronauts could manufacture their own spare parts and medical devices completely on-demand during long space missions.\nHowever, as space agencies and private companies prepare the space technology that will supply in-space, on-demand manufacturing devices that will be sustainable enough for space exploration, Copper3D has already begun incorporating a few concepts of circularity into their research. The idea is to use the same material several times for different applications. Thereby, the material would have to be subjected to several recycling and re-manufacturing processes without losing its antimicrobial properties. In turn, this would save weight, time, resupply missions, and other logistical and medical complications that would make future space missions much more feasible and safer.\nThe partnership between UNO and Copper3D has a history of collaborations with NASA, which began in 2018 with funding to test Copper3D’s flagship antibacterial 3D printing filament in microgravity. The PLA used at the time is called PLACTIVE and integrates a patented additive based on copper nanoparticles that can remove viruses and bacteria. Then in 2019, funding from theNASA Nebraska Space Grantoffice wasawardedto evaluate the feasibility of 3D printing a set of medical devices for astronauts under zero-gravity conditions.\nA pioneer and global leader in antimicrobial materials and applications for the 3D printing industry, Copper3D seeks to solve unique problems in extreme environments, including space exploration bases. Regarding the expectations of this study and the future of the technology, Copper3D Co-Founder and Director of Innovation Daniel Martínez said the startup’s antimicrobial 3D printing technology has quickly found multiple areas of impact since it was created in 2017. He also suggested that the ongoing collaboration with UNO and NASA encourages his team to continue developing new materials and antimicrobial applications “for the big future challenges that we will have face in the fight against viruses and bacteria.”\n",

        "原文": "Jan. 12, 2023 | ByGreg Hadley\nWith the Space Force now in its fourth year of existence, Chief of Space Operations Gen. B. Chance Saltzman wants to develop the service’s essential warfighting processes—and make sure Guardians can perfect them through practice.\nIn a pre-recorded interview with theSpace Force Associationstreamed Jan. 12, Saltzman listed fielding “resilient, ready, combat-credible forces” as his top priority.\n“We have to build the infrastructure and the processes and procedures to make sure [Guardians have] got what they need,” he said. “Whether it’s the test and training infrastructure, simulators that can replicate adversary threats and the interactions you would get, multiple units working together to solve operational challenges—all of that needs to take place before we get into an actual conflict, so that our operators are fully ready. That’s really the priority that I’m going after.”\nWatching Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which bogged down despite Russia’s superior forces and technology, reinforced the importance of high-quality training and tactics, Saltzman said. “The side that practices the best will have an advantage early in the conflict,” Saltzman said. “So that’s what I want to do, make sure we have the skills and the experience on day one of the conflict.”\nSystems and technology count a lot, but if that’s the sole focus, he added, “you only [have] half the equation.” \nThe Space Force needs to develop and validate its approach to combat and dominating in the heavens. “It starts with operational concepts,” Saltzman said. “You say, how is it that we will control the space domain so that we can do what we want to do with space assets, achieve the effects that we want to achieve, while denying the adversary the ability to use their space capabilities to target ground forces and maritime forces and air forces? That’s the classic definition of control of the domain.”\nThe Space Force has acapstone doctrinal document, “Spacepower,” and a commander’s strategic plan for Space Operations Command. But the service is still in the process of fleshing out and codifying its operational concepts. And while control of the domain remains the goal, much like the Air Force seeks air superiority, there are specifics that need to be considered in space, Saltzman said.\n“What’s the plan? And we have to test those [concepts] to make sure we don’t create debris fields,” Saltzman said.“We’re trying to be responsible users in space, but we still have to be able to disrupt an adversary. So how do you do that?”\nOnce those core concepts are finalized, he added, “you start to look at the systems you have and build the tactics, techniques, and procedures that the operators will need to employ.” \nTTPs, as those considerations are often called, cover such basic considerations as “How do I move satellite communications beams? How do I detect a rendezvous proximity opposite to what an adversary is trying to do? How do I do that in real time?” Saltzman said.\nAnd while those tactics can be developed in theory, they also need to be rigorously tested in a way that proves they work, Saltzman said. That’s why investing in test and training infrastructure is so essential.\n“You have to practice it on a range where you can control all the inputs,” Saltzman explained. “You have to practice it against what we would call an opposition force—aggressors—to use the vernacular, because it’s a thinking adversary, and [the fight] is going to be dynamic. How do your operators respond in that dynamic adversarial set of conditions?”\nBuilding the range of skills and experience necessary to optimize the Space Force will take time. Saltzman is eager for Guardians to test and train their skills inside the Space Force, but he also wants them to capture experience outside the service’s bounds. \n“I want to make sure that when you come into the Space Force, your skills and your knowledge of technology, for example, doesn’t atrophy simply because you’re part of the military now,” Saltzman said. One way to do that is to forge deeper partnerships with industry and academia to help ensure Guardians stay “current on what the state of the world is, the state of the art is in terms of technology and leading edge capabilities.”\nThat might entail short tours of duty in industry, where they can be exposed to what the commercial sector is doing. “And tjhen they come back in and bring that knowledge with them,” Saltzman said. “So we keep things fresh inside the Space Force.”\n",

        "原文": "Less than two months prior, booster B1051 sent 60 satellites and an upper stage on their way to orbit, simultaneously becoming the first Falcon 9 first stage to ace ten orbital-class launches and landings, crossing a mostly symbolic – but still significant – milestone years in the making. SpaceX competitors – most notably the United Launch Alliance – have often held the ten-flight mark over its head as the latest in a long line of moving goalposts used to discredit, demean, and look down upon reusable rockets and SpaceX’s efforts to realize them.\nNot long before it was clear that SpaceX would hit that 10-flight target with at least one Falcon booster, competitors working overtime to rationalize a lack of substantial investment into reusable rockets shifted their goalposts again, expanding rationales to require a fleetwide average of ten flights. Instead of explaining why SpaceX’s reusability plans could never work, as many dozens of aerospace executives have assuredly done over the last 5-10 years, the new attitude du jour is to claim that SpaceX’s ability to achieve its reuse goals was never actually in doubt and that the economics of full booster reuse simply can’t make economic sense!\nNow, five and half years after Falcon 9’s first successful booster landing, four years after SpaceX’s first successful booster reuse, and seven weeks after a Falcon 9 first stage’s first ten-flight milestone, Elon Musk says that some of the company’s fleet of boosters are already “slated to fly 20 or possibly 30 times.” Never one to personally rest or allow his companies to rest on their laurels, SpaceX now has a new target to strive for as teams work to ramp and sustain Falcon 9’s launch cadence atrecord-breaking levels.\nBack before Falcon 9’s Block 5 upgrade debuted in May 2018, Musk held a press conference in which he made it abundantly clear that it was SpaceX’s “unequivocal intent” to launch new Falcon boostersup to 10 times without refurbishment.Three years later, although SpaceX ultimately abandoned plans to recover and reuse Falcon 9’s upper stage to prioritize Starship development, Musk’s dream of cutting the cost of launch by a full magnitude hasalmostbeen realized.\nWork needed between flights is less & less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship & Super Heavy is zero.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)June 30, 2021\nTechnically, if SpaceX had developed a reusable upper stage, Falcon 9 as it stands today could feasibly cost just ~10% of its list price (~$6 million. Factoring in the cost of a new expendable upper stage for each mission, the actual cost of a modern Falcon 9 launch with a flight-proven booster and payload fairing is closer to ~$18M. However, in the same June 2021 interview, Musk confirmed that the cost of Falcon 9operations– as in refurbishment, recovery, consumables, and any other recurring work – is just 10% of the cost of launch, effectively confirming that Falcon 9’s Block 5 upgrade really did create a rocket booster that requires virtually no refurbishment.\nBack in Musk’s 2018 conference call, he also noted that beyond plans for up to ten flights without refurbishment, Falcon boosters could feasibly be made to fly dozens or even 100+ times with occasional in-depth maintenance – not unlike modern aircraft. Three years later, Musk is now talking about launching certain Falcon boosters 20 or 30 times, while something approximating the recurring maintenance he once described has yet to crop up.\nIt’s possible, in other words, that SpaceX has found that Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters – which do needsomesmall amount of refurbishment and inspection after each launch – can actually be flown 20 or 30 times without major rework. Ultimately, only time will tell, but Falcon 9 B1051’s 11th flight is expected – this time from the West Coast – as early as late July or August 2021, carryingSpaceX’s first or second dedicated batch of polar Starlink satellites.B1051 arrived at Vandenberg Air/Space Force Base (VAFB) in late June about a month after Falcon 9 B1049 – likely set to become the second booster to complete ten launches.\n",

        "原文": "Stable low-cost organic-based materials could transform X-ray imaging by improving fabrication methods and providing reliable high-resolution imaging results. Now, KAUST researchers have developed a novel approach for designing and building such high-performance scintillator materials for detecting X-rays at low doses.\nA scintillator is a material that, when hit by high-energy ionizing radiation such as X-rays, absorbs the energy and reemits some of it as low energy visible light. Scintillators are widely used for X-ray imaging screens in multiple applications, from airport security scanners to medical radiography. However, most existing scintillators are made from ceramic or perovskite materials, which are often fabricated under harsh conditions and can be plagued with poor stability over time when exposed to light and air.\n\"Organic-based scintillators have inherent advantages, such as low toxicity, high mechanical flexibility, low cost and straightforward large-scale production,\" says Jian-Xin Wang at KAUST, who worked on the project under the supervision of Omar Mohammed and co-workers. \"However, balancing the X-ray absorption capability, exciton utilization efficiency and photoluminescence quantum yield of organic scintillators has proven challenging.\"\nTo date, organic scintillator materials have been hampered by the small range of X-ray frequencies that they can naturally absorb. However, Wang and co-workers realized that X-ray absorption should increase dramatically as the atomic number of the incorporated elements increases. In particular, the team hypothesized that the addition of heavy atoms to the scintillator material could resolve this issue. X-ray photons can interact efficiently with heavy atoms due to their photoelectric effect—the emission of electrons under excitation from radiation.\n\"We used a simple molecular engineering strategy to design novel organic scintillators,\" says Wang. \"We began by introducing chlorine, bromine or iodine to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) chromophores. We then observed how these heavy atoms altered the efficiency and resolution of the resulting X-ray images.\"\nTADF chromophores are useful because they exist in an excited quantum \"triplet state\" in the form of excitons—bound states of electrons and electron holes that are created when a high-energy X-ray photon is absorbed, \"lifting an electron out of its hole.\" The triplet state converts to a singlet state when the chromophores absorb thermal energy. They can then de-excite to the ground state and emit light in a process called delayed fluorescence.\n\"This means that, due to the minimized singlet-triplet energy gap, TADF chromophores can harness both the singlet and triplet excitons that are generated when they are exposed to X-ray radiation,\" says Wang. \"This dramatically improves the exciton utilization efficiency of the scintillator, which in turn provides much higher X-ray spatial imaging resolution and ultralow detection sensitivity,\" says Mohammed.\nThe technique of fabricating screens using scintillators doped with heavy atoms has proved successful so far. One of the team's scintillators, made using TADF-Br (bromine) chromophores, exceeded the resolution of most reported organic and organometallic scintillation screens.\n\"These fabricated screens provide a powerful design approach and promising new alternative materials for making X-ray imaging scintillators with outstanding sensitivity, low cost and high stability,\" says Mohammed.\nRelated research is published in the journals Nature Photonics and Matter.\nThe team is currently manufacturing a portable X-ray sensor with their fabricated screen for high-resolution medical imaging, including dental examinations and health checks. Their design could also advance the development of tiny wearable X-ray devices.\n",

        "原文": "World Nuclear News16 March 2022\nUK-based innovative reactor developer Newcleo has signed a framework agreement with ENEA - the Italian national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development - to cooperate on the development of small, lead-cooled fast reactors.\n\"The goal of the framework agreement is to produce energy in a safe, reliable, sustainable way through innovative small-scale nuclear systems to be deployed outside of Italy (where no civil nuclear activity is permitted),\" Newcleo said. \"Specifically, it foresees the development of advanced nuclear systems of small dimensions (Advanced Modular Reactors), cooled with lead instead of water, making them much simpler and more reliable.\"\nIn collaboration with ENEA, Newcleo will build an electrical prototype of the lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) system, which will not use radioactive materials or nuclear fuel, to allow the study of thermo-dynamic, mechanical and functional performances. The joint activities also concern the design of an Accelerator Driven System, which will make it possible to reduce the volume of existing nuclear waste.\nNewcleo said it intends to construct the first nuclear prototype in a \"nuclear-friendly\" country within seven years, and subsequently market them internationally to gradually replace the current Generation II and III reactors.\nUnder the cooperation agreement, ENEA will make available to Newcleo its Brasimone Research Centre for safety analysis, training and testing activities. In addition, new research infrastructures will be implemented, favouring wherever possible the use and refurbishment of the existing experimental halls and laboratories. Investments by Newcleo towards all these could exceed EUR50 million (USD55 million) over a 10-year period. The company plans to employ a team of 25-30 engineers, who will work permanently for about 10 years at the Brasimone Centre.\nA working group will be set up with ENEA and Newcleo personnel to exchange information and knowledge, and jointly develop equipment and technological codes. In addition to the close cooperation between scientific staff, the partnership includes the alignment of experimental programmes on innovative nuclear systems, mutual assistance in the design, numerical simulation and construction of key components, systems and plants.\n\"ENEA has accumulated a unique global know-how in the field of liquid lead,\" said Newcleo CEO Stefano Buono. \"By working together with ENEA researchers and investing in the facilities at the Brasimone Centre, we will not only take important steps for the realisation of our project, but we will also contribute to the advancement of research in Italy.\"\n\"In the last 20 years, ENEA has carried out a wide range of research studies and experiments in this sector, where it has reached a leading position at an international level,\" said ENEA President Gilberto Dialuce. \"This agreement allows us to collaborate with the goal of ensuring the safe and long-term production of electricity in plants to be built abroad, but with significant repercussions on investments and employment at our local level.\"\nNewcleo on 31 August last year announced its incorporation with the closing of a USD118 million initial capital raising and the acquisition of Hydromine Nuclear Energy. It has already created a Nuclear Research Center based in Turin, Italy, where about 100 nuclear physicists and engineers will work and share know-how with leading international experts and scientists. The company says its first project, Re-Act, is a small LFR that \"shall soon satisfy commercial demand for small electric generating units on islands, in remote communities and for naval propulsion.\"\n",
